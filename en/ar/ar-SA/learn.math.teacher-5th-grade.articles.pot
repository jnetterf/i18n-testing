msgid "The support for teachers to bring high standards to their classrooms, however, has lagged behind. Research shows that teacher training in the U.S. is currently insufficient in preparing teachers to teach the demanding new standards (Center for Research in Mathematics and Science Education, 2010). And though some resources exist that “unpack” the standards, few, if any, explain and illustrate the standards. “Unpacking” the standards one by one can also result in a disjointed presentation that neglects the structure and coherence of the standards. In creating the Content Guides, we aimed to provide busy teachers with a practical, easy-to-read resource on their grade-specific standards and how to help all students learn them. There is ample empirical evidence that when teachers have both strong knowledge of the math content that they teach, and the pedagogical knowledge to help students master that content knowledge, their students learn more (Baumert et. al., 2010; Hill, Rowan and Ball, 2005; Rockoff et. al., 2008). With the Content Guides in hand, we hope that teachers will find more success in helping their students make progress toward college- and career-readiness."

This is to be expected because the new high standards are a significant departure from prior standards.

msgid "There are lots of connections among standards in Grade 5; if you think about the standards long enough, you’ll probably start to see these relationships everywhere.[7] In this section, we’ll talk about the connection between the standards in the Number & Operations in Base Ten (NBT) domain and the standard in the first cluster of the Measurement & Data (MD) domain. The standard in this MD cluster is a supporting standard and can be used to support work with the NBT standards.\n"
"5.MD.A | Convert like measurement units within a given measurement system.\n"
"5.MD.A.1\n"
"Convert among different-sized standard measurement units within a given measurement system (e.g., convert 5 cm to 0.05 m), and use these conversions in solving multistep, real world problems.\n"
"This standard builds on work with conversions in Grade 4, where students convert from larger to smaller units. (4.MD.A.1) In Grade 5, students build on this understanding to convert measurements from a smaller unit to a larger unit. Students relate the idea that a digit in one place is 1/10 the size of the digit in the place to its left (5.NBT.A.1 )to the idea that smaller metric units are 1/10, 1/100, or 1/1000 the size of larger units. The following lesson gives an example of this relationship.\n"
"EngageNY Grade 5, Module 1, Lesson 4: Application\n"
"T: Here is a place value chart. (Show the place value chart from thousands to thousandths without other headings.)\n"
"math-g5-m1-topic-a-lesson-4.png\n"
"T: Here is a set of column headings based on metric length related to our place value chart, designating one meter as the base unit, or the ones place.\n"
"T: Use your meter strip to show and explain to your partner the lengths that relate to the tenths, hundredths, and thousandths places. (Move through the tenths, hundredths, and thousandths until identifying and naming meter as 1 millimeter.)\n"
"Grade 5, Module 1, Lesson 4 from EngageNY.org of the New York State Education Department is licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 3.0.\n"
"Understanding the relationship between the metric units and the place value chart helps students know whether they are moving from a larger unit to a smaller unit or the reverse. It also illustrates the multiplicative relationship between units.\n"
"Since this is a supporting cluster, students use conversions to solve multistep, real-world measurement problems in order to support addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division with whole numbers, decimals, and fractions. This builds from work in Grade 4 where students engage with measurement contexts involving whole numbers and simple fractions and decimals. (4.MD.A.2) The contexts for the multistep problems should involve measurement systems the students are familiar with: distance, intervals of time, liquid volumes, masses of objects, and money. The example below involves converting from a smaller unit to a larger unit.\n"

"What time was it 2011 minutes after the beginning of January 1, 2011?\n"
"Solution\n"
"January 1, 2011 begins at 12:00 AM. To find the time 2011 minutes later will require changing units since time is told in hours and minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour so to see how many hours there are in 2011 minutes we can perform the division problem 2011 ÷ 60. Since 30 × 60 = 1800, we can write\n"
"2011 = 30 × 60 + 211.\n"
"Next, there are three groups of 60 in 211, with a remainder of 31 so we get\n"
"2011 = 30 × 60 + 3 × 60 + 31.\n"
"Using the distributive property this last expression is equivalent to\n"
"2011 = (30 + 3) × 60 + 31.\n"
"So 2011 minutes is the same as 33 hours and 31 minutes. Now 33 hours is one day and an additional 9 hours so this means that 2011 minutes is one day, nine hours, and thirty-one minutes. So 2011 minutes after the beginning of 2011 it is January 2 and it is 9:31 AM.\n"
"“Minutes and Days” by Illustrative Mathematics is licensed under CC BY 4.0.\n"
"In this task, students divide a 4-digit number by a two-digit number to convert hours to minutes (2011 ÷ 60). Alternatively, as shown in the solution, students can use multiplication to solve the problem."

For example, starting off working with the four operations serves as a nice “refresher” for students, as they have been learning about addition and subtraction since Kindergarten and multiplication and division since Grade 3. It also connects closely with work on place value in Grade 4. Finally, students will be using the four operations all year in a variety of contexts, so starting off with some experiences with them will support later learning."

msgid "However, memorizing rules without developing understanding is not enduring for most students because these tricks have little substantive meaning, are easy to forget, and are often misapplied. In contrast to memorizing rules, using a number line to teach rounding helps students visualize how numbers are closer to a particular ten or hundred; it is strategy based on students’ existing number sense. While we certainly wouldn’t expect students to draw a number line every time they round for the duration of their mathematical lives, the visual representation helps to form a solid conceptual basis for rounding. The example below asks students to use a number n and determine which number to round it to."
