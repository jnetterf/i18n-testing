A variable is depicted as a letter which can take any value. We will also learn to write linear expressions and ways to solve them.This tutorial doesn't explore algebra so much as it introduces the history and ideas that underpin it."

Dot plots and frequency tables both display how often different values occur in a set of numerical data. Remember, like always, the names don't matter as much as the idea behind them. A dot plot is like a bar chart, but it displays data using dots (not bars). And a frequency table is like a dot plot, but it displays data in a simple table (not a fancy diagram)."
