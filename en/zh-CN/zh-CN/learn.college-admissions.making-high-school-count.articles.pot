msgid "The good news is that you’ve already begun your preparation!  In large part, the SAT and ACT are meant to be tests of what you have learned in high school.  The very best way to prepare for these tests, then, is to take challenging classes and work hard to understand the content.  So ask those questions in geometry, revise that paper for English one more time, and sign up for that AP History class even if it sounds like a lot of work.  Taking your studies seriously, more than any test prep tricks and gimmicks, will ensure that you are primed for success on both the SAT and ACT."
