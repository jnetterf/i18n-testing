msgid "If the college admissions’ website “Recommends” an interview, you should interpret that as it being required. Sometimes if candidates are on the cusp of being admitted, admissions officers will look at how much interest they’ve demonstrated in their school. Visiting campus and scheduling a tour, interview, and/or overnight are all great ways of doing this. If your ability to visit colleges is constrained by your financial circumstances, you can always ask the school if they have a program to help lower-income students visit, or whether they hold virtual interviews for students who can't make it to campus. More and more schools are doing this, and it never hurts to check! Visiting college campuses is probably the most exciting part of applying, so enjoy it and let it motivate you to finish strong, work hard on your applications, and get excited for what the next four years of your life could look like."

msgid "If you already know you want to attend a particular school, you might think there’s no reason to visit. But touring a campus isn’t just a way to learn more about a school--it’s also a way to show admissions officers you’re truly interested in attending. Some colleges take demonstrated interest into account more than others, but all schools want to enroll students who are eager to attend. Colleges want to keep their transfer rates low and if you’re already enthusiastic about their school, they assume you’re less likely to want to transfer later on. Colleges also have an easier time predicting their yield if they offer acceptance letters to the students who consider it one of their top choices and therefore have a higher likelihood of actually attending. When admissions can somewhat accurately predict the ratio of students they accept that actually enroll (as opposed to students that are accepted but choose to enroll elsewhere), they end up with their ideal class size. Colleges send acceptance letters to more students than they actually have the capacity for since they know not all students will decide to attend. This explains why the ivy leagues tend to consider demonstrated interest far less (or sometimes not at all) because they assume you'd rather attend their institution over a less selective one."
