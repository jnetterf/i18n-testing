msgid "There are nearly 3,000 4-year colleges in the United States, and each has its own approach to determining how much assistance to offer to students with financial need (often referred to as need-based aid) [iii].  As a general rule of thumb, the colleges that offer the best need-based aid are the colleges that are the most selective public and private institutions in the country.  This may initially seem like a paradox.  Why would many of the nation’s best colleges – colleges that receive so many applications that they could easily fill every seat with students whose families could pay full price – choose to offer the best financial assistance? First, it’s because these colleges believe that your long-term potential for success has little to do with your family’s present income, and by extension, your family’s income should have little to do with whether you can attend college.  Second, it’s because these colleges have substantial sums of money that they have raised over the years, and these funds allow them to put their beliefs about your potential into action by offering financial assistance if you need it."

However, the university actually offers substantial assistance to ensure that finances do not keep you from attending. For instance, families of students who make less than \\$60,000 per year and have typical assets are expected to contribute \\$0 for a student's tuition, room and board, books, etc. Similarly, students whose families make between \\$60,000 and \\$100,000 receive scholarships to cover the entire cost of tuition. These generous financial aid policies are one reason that schools like Stanford see such a high percentage (95%) of their students graduate – the payoff of going to college – with an average of only \\$15,000 in total federal loan debt [iii]."

msgid "So far, we’ve been exploring the costs and benefits of a 4-year college degree. What we’ve left unsaid: some students go to college and never finish. Students who drop out of college have substantially lower earnings, higher unemployment, and greater likelihood of defaulting on their debt than students who ultimately graduate:"

msgid "Some argue that continuing to college means giving up the chance to get a job immediately out of high school and begin earning money. This is certainly true; however, the delay in earning can pay off. The average 4-year bachelor’s degree holder, for instance, earns nearly \\$1 million dollars more over the course of their lifetime than someone who holds only a high school diploma:"

msgid "There are nearly 3,000 4-year colleges in the United States, and each has its own approach to determining how much assistance to offer to students with financial need (often referred to as need-based aid) [ii].  As a general rule of thumb, the colleges that offer the best need-based aid are the colleges that are the most selective public and private institutions in the country.  This may initially seem like a paradox. Why would many of the nation’s best colleges – colleges that receive so many applications that they could easily fill every seat with students whose families could pay full price – choose to offer the best financial assistance? First, it’s because these colleges believe that your long-term potential for success has little to do with your family’s present income, and by extension, your family’s income should have little to do with whether you can attend college. Second, it’s because these colleges have substantial sums of money that they have raised over the years, and these funds allow them to put their beliefs about your potential into action by offering financial assistance if you need it."

msgid "Yet, if you proceed cautiously, the answer to the question around the economic benefits of college is definitive.  Financial aid can make it affordable to attend, and as a graduate you can earn far more over the course of your career. In short, **yes** - college can be one of the very best investments that you make."

msgid "[[☃ image 1]]This brings us to perhaps the most important point about the economics of higher education. While college can offer a tremendous boost in income relative to cost, these financial benefits overwhelmingly go to students who finish their 4-year degrees rather than those who start the college journey but do not persist."
