"Absolute advantage | The ability to produce more of a good than another entity, given the same resources. For example, in a single day, Owen can produce 10 cars and Penny can produce 15 cars, so Penny has absolute advantage in producing cars.\n"
"Comparative advantage | The ability to produce a good at a lower opportunity cost than another entity. For example, Owen gives up five units of corn per car produced, and Penny gives up eight units of corn per car produced. Therefore, Owen has comparative advantage in producing cars.\n"
"Specialization | Producing the good that a country has comparative advantage in\n"
"Trade | Exchanging goods with another entity\n"

"Term | Definition \n"
"- | - | -\n"
"economics | The social science dealing with the study of how individuals and societies choose to allocate scarce resources.\n"
"social science | A scientific approach to studying human behavior and interactions.\n"
"scarcity | The fact that there is a limited amount of resources to satisfy unlimited wants\n"
"models | A way of creating a simplified framework to better understand complicated processes. In economics, models are typically graphical or mathematical.\n"
"*ceteris paribus* | A Latin phrase meaning \"all else equal\". The ceteris paribus assumption means that all else is assumed to not be changing at the same time. Most economic models make this assumption.\n"
"agent | Some entity making a decision. This can be an individual, a household, a business, a city, or even the government of a country. Economic models describe the actions of these agents.\n"
"incentives | Rewards or punishments associated with a possible action. Agents make decisions based on incentives.\n"
"rational | An agent is considered to be rational if, when given full information, does not choose a course of action that makes themselves intentionally worse off. Most economic models assume agents are rational.\n"
"marginal | Referring to *the next thing* or the *last thing*. For instance, if you are deciding whether or not to eat one more cookie, do another hour of exercise, or work one more hour, that is marginal thinking.\n"
"marginal analysis | Analytical thinking about the additional benefit compared to the additional cost of an action. For instance, whether the additional benefit of one more cookie outweighs the cost of one more cookie.\n"
"positive analysis | Analytical thinking about objective facts and cause-and-effect relationships, such as prices and quantities of goods sold.\n"
"normative analysis | Analytical thinking about what we should value or a course of action that should be taken, such as the importance of environmental factors and the approach to managing them.\n"
"microeconomics | The field of economics concerned with the individual agents, such as people, households, or firms.\n"
"macroeconomics | The field of economics concerned with economics aggregates and the overall economies.\n"
"economic aggregates | Measures such as the unemployment rate, rate of inflation, and national output that summarize all markets, rather than individual markets. Economic aggregates are frequently used as measures of the economic performance of an economy."

"* The term *surplus* in the context of consumer, producer or community surplus should not be confused with the term *surplus* learned in earlier units. When the quantity supplied in a market exceeds the quantity demanded, we say there is a *surplus* in the market. This *excess supply* is undesirable and represents an overproduction of a good. Community surplus, on the other, is desirable and will be maximized when a market is achieving allocative efficiency. \n"
"* Calculating areas of consumer and producer surplus or deadweight loss requires the ability to calculate the areas of both a triangle and a rectangle. Keep this equation in mind. For a triangle $Area = \\dfrac{1}{2} (base \\times height)$, and for a rectagle $Area = base \\times height$"

"- **Consumer surplus** is the difference between willingness to pay for a good and the price that consumers actually pay for it. Each price along a demand curve also represents a consumers **marginal benefit** of each unit of consumption. The difference between a consumer's marginal benefit for a unit of consumption, and what they actually pay, represents how much benefit a consumer get's from the price they are paying. [[☃ explanation 1]]\n"
"-  **Producer surplus** represents the difference between  the price a seller receives and their willingness to sell for each quantity. Each price along a supply curve also represents a seller's **marginal cost** of  producing each unit of production. Therefore the difference between what the price that the seller for each unit, and what it cost for the seller to produce that last unit, represents the seller's benefit from the price they are getting.\n"

" - Regardless of whether a tax is imposed on a buyer or a seller, both will experience a reduction in surplus. \n"
" -  **Tax revenue** is the dollar amount of tax collected. For an excise (or, *per unit*) tax, this is quantity sold multiplied by the value of the per unit tax. Tax revenue is counted as part of total surplus.[[☃ explanation 2]]\n"
" - Some of the consumer surplus from before the tax will now be part of the tax revenue. The amount of the tax revenue collected that previously belonged to consumer surplus is the **consumer's tax burden**\n"
" - Some of the producer surplus from before the tax will now be part of tax revenue. The amount of the tax revenue collected that previously belonged to producer surplus is the **producer's tax burden**.\n"
" - **Tax incidence** refers to how a tax is distributed between the buyer and the seller. For instance, if the amount of consumer surplus that is reallocated to tax revenue is greater than the amount of producer surplus that is reallocated to tax revenue, we would say that the incidence of the tax falls more heavily on consumers. [[☃ explanation 1]]\n"
" - Because the tax alters the quantity that is sold in the market, it will result in a deadweight loss."

In economics, the term **utility** refers to the happiness, benefit or value a consumer gets from a good or service. In other words, consumers are not satisficers who will settle for \"good enough\".

"* The signs in your calculations of $XED$ and $YED$ are particularly important. If the price and quantity change in opposite directions when calculating $XED$ then the goods must be complements and the coefficient will be negative. If income and quantity change in opposite directions when calculating $YED$ then the good must be inferior and the coefficient will be negative. A positive $XED$ coefficient means goods are substitutes and a positive $YED$ coefficient means the good is normal.\n"
"* The absolute value of $YED$ and $XED$ tell you about the elasticity.\n"
"* A note on terminology: When describing the price elasticity of demand for a good it is simple enough to say \"demand is elastic\" or \"demand is inelastic\". But when describing the cross and income elasticities of demand special attention should be paid to your use of the terminology. For $XED$ you must specify that demand is cross-price elastic or inelastic with respect to another good. For $YED$ you must specify that demand for a good is either income elastic or income inelastic.\n"
"* It can be tempting to make normative judgments about the qualities of a good, but it is important to remember that these are objective measures.

"* The mobility of resources: Goods for which production can be increased or decreased rapidly due to easily mobilized resources will have a more elastic supply compared to goods whose inputs are difficult to mobilize. For instance, the supply of t-shirts is more elastic than the supply of airplanes, since t-shirts require much cheaper and more readily available resources to manufacture than airplanes.\n"
"* Commodities versus manufactured goods: Commodities such as coal, wild fish, corn, copper and other raw materials extracted directly from nature tend to have relatively inelastic supplies, due to the fact that in any period of time the quantity available to extract is relatively fixed.\n"
"* The amount of time following a price change: For any good, supply becomes more elastic as more time passes following a change in its price. In the immediate period following a price change, producers will be unable to respond and supply will be nearly perfectly inelastic. But as time passes existing producers will be able to mobilize resources to adjust production levels.\n"
"* The ability to store inventories: Non-perishable goods that can easily be stockpiled will have a more elastic supply than goods that would spoil or are difficult and expensive to store inventories of. For instance, coffee beans can be more easily stored than fresh milk, so suppliers of coffee can quickly draw from inventories or add to inventories in response to price changes, whereas fresh milk will spoil and the quantity supplied can therefore not be easily increased or decreased as price changes in a particular period of time."

"* *The number of substitutes* a good has: The more substitutes a good has, the *more elastic* demand tends to be. Consumers are more likely to simply switch to a substitutes if a good's price rises or consume more of a good when its price falls when there are many close substitutes. \n"
"* *The proportion of a consumer's budget* a good's price represents: A particular percentage change in a relatively expensive good's price will be more noticeable to consumers than the same percentage change in the price of a relatively cheap good, therefore consumers tend to be more responsive to price changes of more expensive goods.\n"
"* *Whether a good is a luxury or a necessity*: Luxury goods can easily be lived without and therefore demand tends to be more elastic than for necessities, for  which consumers will be less responsive to price changes.\n"
"* *Whether a good is addictive*: Addictive goods such as tobacco products tend to have relatively *inelastic* demands, for the obvious reason that even if price rises people tend to continue to consume the good due to its addictiveness.\n"
"* *The amount of time* following a price change: In the short-run following a price change, demand is less elastic than it is over a longer period of time. Consumers will notice price changes over time and be able to shift their consumption accordingly (find substitutes if the price has risen or switch from other goods if the price has fallen)."
