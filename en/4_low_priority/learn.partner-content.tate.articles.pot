msgid "But beginning in the 1960s, with equal rights and feminist movements in full swing, there was a boom of women teaching and studying in art schools in the United States and Europe. These became sites of feminist activity, encouraging the representation of women in museums and galleries. This movement of women in the arts fostered a large body of theory and diverse artistic practice, redefining what was possible in the studio and beyond and paving the way for many women artists practicing today."

msgid "But beginning in the 20th century, things began to change not only for women artists, but for women across the domestic and public spheres. A new women's movement, with an emphasis on the advocacy of equal rights, organisations devoted to women's interests, and a new generation of female professionals and artists transformed the traditionally male-driving social structure around the world. These social shifts, which began to emerge at the beginning of the century, developed further with the advent of World War I and expanding global unrest, propelling more women into the workforce and exposing them to social, professional, and political situations that had previously been limited to men."

This was due to a number of factors: art forms like textiles and what we call the “decorative arts” were often dismissed as craft and not “fine art”; many women were kept from pursuing a general education, let alone arts training; and finally the men who dominated the discipline both in practice and history often believed women to be inferior artists.

In the same decade, artist Linder drew on the spirit of punk and the anti-establishment politics of Dada to create photomontages that subverted traditional media images into unsettling statements.

msgid "The project of seeking out women artists excluded from the canon has also encouraged a redefinition of art practices themselves, inviting us to rethink what we call the “decorative arts,” installation art, and performance art revolving around artists’ bodies. By encouraging scholars to seek out these forgotten women, the project continues on today. It is opening up beyond the Western canon to include women of colour from around the world, women who help us understand that there is no one “female art” but rather that art shapes and is shaped by culture, that it conveys cultural ideas about beauty, gender, and power, and that it can be a powerful tool to question issues of race, class, and identity."

Even when it comes to the earliest works of art known to us, like the voluptuous Venus of Willendorf from 25000 B.C.E. and other small stone carvings, no one is certain if these works of art were created by women or men. On the other hand, objects like weavings and clothing have always been associated with women’s craft, from the story of Penelope’s courageous weaving in Homer’s epic tale _The Odyssey_, from 800 B.C.E., to the 11th century Bayeaux Tapestry, a 270-foot long fabric document telling the story of medieval Britain, likely woven and embroidered by women. Still, women artists faced difficulty in the centuries that followed when trying to engage with the art world and canon."

msgid "[[☃ image 1]]According to a story by Pliny the Elder, a Roman writer from the first century C.E., the first drawing ever made was by a woman named Dibutades, who traced the silhouette of her lover on a wall. Whether you choose to believe this account or not, it is worth noting that although Western mythology tells us that a woman was the first artist, her female successors received little attention until the end of the 20th century. From antiquity onwards, only a small sample of women found their way into the tales of the greatest artists. Even then, they were often described as unusually talented women who overcame the limitations of their gender in order to excel in what was believed to be a masculine field. British artist Mary Beale ([who you can learn more about in this video](www.khanacademy.org/partner-content/tate/meet-500-years/16th-18th-century/v/room-1650-1730?utm_source=khanacademy.org&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=khan_academy)) was a successful portraitist in the late 1600s, but much of her success was attributed to the fact that her husband oversaw their studio and presented her works as experiments in the painting methods he developed.

With the idea of memory in mind, some artists try to document things exactly as they are in order to create a record for future generations. But others deliberately frame the past in different or unexpected ways to change the way we think about history. So how does art shape our collective memory of the past?

msgid "Some art engages with memory by trying to erase it entirely, as in the case of Michael Landy’s performance _Break Down_, in which he catalogued every item in his possession before destroying them in a public event. Similarly, Swiss artist Jean Tinguely was known for creating a sculptural machine that was designed to destroy itself completely. Some art, like time-based and performance art, never even exists in a fixed space and seems to disappear entirely when not being performed. But the ephemeral nature of this art only strengthens its connection with memory, which is where you could say it actually resides."

msgid "The task of preserving memory is difficult when it comes to art, because there will inevitably be tension between an object invented by a subjective mind and the objective fact or event it is meant to depict. Even a map can be inaccurate when drawn from just one perspective. Knowing this, many artists use art to tell stories about personal and cultural memory that are open to interpretation, that reframe the past not as a fixed narrative but as a multiplicity of voices from diverse points of view. This allows us to think twice about our history and how it has been shaped, and how we might best document things to come."

And that’s not counting the many sculptures, films, installations, textiles, and time-based media included in the collection, each with their own unique and often unconventional materials. Because of this, technical examinations and analyses are crucial to developing an understanding of how to properly care for these artworks."

They carefully study parts of the collection that are difficult to conserve and poorly understood in terms of construction and materials. They undertake analysis of materials and structures which provide resources for researchers and conservators in the future. For a small number of contemporary paintings, like those by Chris Ofili, these experiments involve the team creating works of art in the same style and materials as the artist (including elephant dung) and subjecting them to variably controlled conditions to see how the original will respond to movement, light, and the aging process."

Cleaning is a delicate and demanding part of conserving works of art. For paintings, layers of dirt, discoloured varnish and old restorations that may be disfiguring or obscuring parts of the composition are painstakingly removed, revealing the original paint surfaces of work of art like in Thomas Gainsborough’s portrait below. Structural work might also be necessary if the canvas or wooden panels that support the paint surface need strengthening or have been damaged, and ultimately some paintings can be conserved but not restored due to how much they have degenerated."

msgid "In recent decades, artists have become increasingly interested in archives as inspiration for their work, but also in its use as an artistic medium. The impulse to accumulate, sort, and document drives the process of making assemblages and collages just as much as it dictates the creation of an archive. Many conceptual and performance artists use archival materials and formats in the work, blurring the line between art and documentation. And some artists have begun to question how to revisit and re-enact their own work after it has been archived. In what ways can archives go beyond documentation and foster inspiration? How do archives not only trace the creative process but also become part of that process itself?"

Many artists to this day are making work that speaks directly to the viewer on issues surrounding conflict. Sometimes, as in the case of British artist Bob and Roberta Smith below, the message can be quite literal."

msgid "From the ancient world through the Renaissance, artists were fascinated by the drama and physicality of war, and many of their great masterpieces were effectively pro-war in that they glorified military action. But by the conclusion of the Second World War in 1945, the majority of artists were using their practice to openly condemn conflict. As early as 1915, the [Dada](http://www.tate.org.uk/learn/online-resources/glossary/d/dada?utm_source=khanacademy.org&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=khan_academy) movement was founded as a direct response to the senseless death of the First World War, revolting against the traditional beliefs of a pro-war society by making art that was silly, irreverent, and entirely in opposition to that society."

"But what if you were a contemporary artist oppressed by a hostile regime, or marginalised by those in power? What if you relied upon your art to be your voice? Many contemporary artists have moved away from the immediate emotional impact of works like Picasso’s in favour of more conceptual statements on the issues that face them. Some artists engage with the restrictions placed upon them in a playful manner, like when Wang Peng created installations and performances at a time when performance art was banned in China, often forcing the authorities to engage with his work by the very act of their own intervention."

msgid "As with every other aspect of human life, conflict has served as inspiration for art across cultures and eras. Artwork documenting war had been popular for centuries, but in the 18th and 19th centuries in Europe, artists were becoming more willing to incorporate very recent events into major paintings. Take a look at the painting by American painter [John Singleton Copley](http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artists/john-singleton-copley-113?utm_source=khanacademy.org&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=khan_academy) above, which shows the British defending the island of Jersey from a French invasion in 1781 and was painted only two years later. In its centre, a young Major named Francis Peirson tumbles dramatically as he is shot by a sniper. While the battle serves as the subject of the painting, its focal point is the death of the young hero–what kind of emotion do you think this painting was trying to evoke in its viewers? Is Peirson’s death just a tragedy, or a tragic victory? After it was first displayed, the painting garnered rave reviews from its British audience, who hailed it as an image of heroic patriotism."

msgid "British artist [Peter Kennard](http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artists/peter-kennard-10184?utm_source=khanacademy.org&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=khan_academy) creates internal conflicts in his artwork through the use of photomontage, or the pasting together of disparate photos and other visual elements to create an entirely new image. With pictures of the earth being drowned in oil and missiles exploding through peace signs, Kennard’s work is hardly subtle. But his images are powerful in that they make explicit things we might know or feel and make contradiction visible. His Disappeared Prisoners is even more poignant in that the soldier appears to be using the tools of the artist. But instead of creating art, he is painting over the faces of the men and women who were “disappeared” and murdered under Augusto Pinochet’s regime in 1970s Chile, wearing gloves as if to avoid dirtying himself with the deed."

msgid "Sometimes rather than creating images of conflict or creating art that responds to it directly, artists employ conflict as an internal quality of their work. Some artists deliberately create an element of contradiction in their artwork in order to create tension or irony, to highlight certain qualities, or to create unforeseen relationships that allow us to think differently. Through unexpected juxtapositions, they challenge our expectations and perceptions of the everyday."

"When it comes to [representational art](http://www.tate.org.uk/learn/online-resources/glossary/r/representational?utm_source=khanacademy.org&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=khan_academy), art is by its very nature a document of the time, place, and culture in which it was created. For those artists who have lived through and engaged with conflict, their work offers one way of passing on the experiences of those things we can’t all live through. Some artists have chosen to document conflict while it rages, while many have found it impossible to do so without a degree of commentary embedded in their work. Still others have embraced the spirit of conflict in their own work to speak to issues with particular poignancy."

But look more carefully, and you might notice that its handles are actually knives. With this one subversion, Hatoum has taken an ordinary object and turned it into something full of potential and meaning. What kind of person might consider using a wheelchair with knives for handles? Could this wheelchair represent the potential dangers lurking in the everyday?"

Having studied in London, El-Salahi returned to his native Sudan and forged a visual vocabulary by fusing his own experience of Islamic, African, Arab and Western artistic traditions. In 1975, El-Salahi was wrongfully imprisoned by the Sudanese government for six harrowing months, and this period as a political prisoner deeply informed the artist's relationship to spirituality and trauma. Using the ochre–or deep yellow–colour of the Sudanese earth in his paintings, El-Salahi has maintained strong links to his homeland while experimenting with modern forms. While staying rooted, he stands as a global example by using his art to address, as he says, \"your self, the people of your own culture, family, and neighbourhood, and [finally] all human beings, wherever they might be.\" Only recently has this major figure in African modernism been brought into a more global art history through the efforts of major [exhibitions](http://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-modern/exhibition/ibrahim-el-salahi-visionary-modernist?utm_source=khanacademy.org&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=khan_academy)."

The artist layers references to the Xhosa culture of South Africa through his titles while using similarly charged materials. The old and punctured inner tubes of car tyres that he gathers from repair shops in Johannesburg refer to the urban experience of life there. In this case, Hlobo uses the abstract qualities of modernism to get us thinking about real issues around art in culture, in Africa and beyond."

msgid "And some Asian artists who were at the forefront of modernism are still working inventively today. Born in Chiniot, Pakistan (formerly a part of India), artist [Iqbal Geoffrey](http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artists/iqbal-geoffrey-1150?utm_source=khanacademy.org&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=khan_academy) continues to paint, fusing Eastern and Western elements in his work. One of his early works, _Epitaph 1958_, speaks to a modern sensibility while reflecting elements of traditional belief in his native country. The circular shapes are derived from the mandala, which is a symbol used in Hindu mythology as a focal point in meditation and the source of spiritual refreshment. Gold permeates the painting giving it a timeless effect and tries to pull the viewer into what the artist calls \"a new world, perpetual and mystic.\" An _epitaph_ is literally a text commemorating the deceased–and in this case Geoffrey has visually written one for the year 1958 in Pakistan, which saw political unrest and a military coup."

msgid "Another Pakistani artist, [Rasheed Araeen](http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artists/rasheed-araeen-2364?utm_source=khanacademy.org&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=khan_academy), focused heavily on minimalist sculpture after moving to Britain in the 1960s. However, he received hardly any institutional recognition for his contribution to the modernist discourse there, being side-lined as a non-European whose work was never seen as part of the mainstream. Because of this, in the 1970s and 1980, Araeen began experimenting with other mediums like performance, photography, painting and sculpture. With these forms he became openly political and drew attention to the way in which certain artists were invisible within the dominant Euro-centric culture. _Bismullah_ is a collage that brings together strong symbols of faith, identity, and war. The green colour is the main component of the Pakistani flag as well as an important symbolic colour in Islam, a reference heightened with the intricate golden patterning. Candles have significance for both Muslim and Christian ceremonies, while the grisly bloodstain in the centre could refer to ritual sacrifice or bloodletting–or more simply to bloodshed and war. Perhaps Araeen's collage is an invitation to think about religious conflict not just in Asia, but around the world. Hear Araeen speak more about his work in [our Audio Arts series](http://www.tate.org.uk/audio-arts/volume-8/number-2-3?utm_source=khanacademy.org&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=khan_academy)."

His _Sunflower Seeds,_ which was staged in Tate Modern's [Turbine Hall in 2010](http://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-modern/exhibition/unilever-series-ai-weiwei-sunflower-seeds?utm_source=khanacademy.org&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=khan_academy), is a work of art made up of millions of tiny individual works of art, each apparently identical, but actually unique. While they look realistic at first glance, these life-sized sunflower seed husks are in fact hand-crafted and delicately painted. Each seed has been individually sculpted and brushed by specialists working in small-scale workshops in the Chinese city of Jingdezhen. Far from being industrially produced, they are the effort of hundreds of skilled hands. Poured into the interior of the Turbine Hall’s vast industrial space, the 100 million seeds formed a seemingly infinite landscape. To make these tiny seeds, Ai WeiWei and his skilled workers manipulated what has historically been one of China's most prized exports: porcelain. So _Sunflower Seeds_ invites us to think about labour, community, and what it really means to be \"Made in China.\" In the meantime, many more [young Chinese artists](/partner-content/tate/global-modernisms/asian-art/v/contemporary-china?utm_source=khanacademy.org&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=khan_academy) are working in an arts scene full of possibility and opportunity."

msgid "The arts of Asia share a long and unique history, stretching from thousands of years ago into a rich modern and contemporary practice today. At the height of modernism in the middle of the 20th century, artists like Japan's [Yayoi Kusama](http://www.tate.org.uk/context-comment/articles/planting-seed?utm_source=khanacademy.org&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=khan_academy) were flourishing among the New York art scene. They were inspired by modernist traditions while forging unique voices linked to their origins and identities. In what we call the Western world, there had long been a tendency to look at the art of Asia from an [orientalist](http://www.tate.org.uk/learn/online-resources/glossary/o/orientalist?utm_source=khanacademy.org&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=khan_academy) perspective, categorising it as \"other,\" as something entirely exotic. But as you'll soon see, modern and contemporary Asian artists have launched a tradition of instigating global engagement while celebrating their identities."

His works were inspired by and often incorporated images of deities and other traditionally Indian genres, such as miniatures and temple maps. Khakar managed to communicate these images with humour as well as a sense of celebration, depicting a culture mostly unrecognised in the West in its true form. In _You Can't Please All_, a naked, life-sized self portrait looks out over an unfolding townscape. With this figure, Khakar found a way to proclaim even more than just his heritage–in this case, his homosexuality–and celebrate an even more deeply unrecognised and taboo culture."

msgid "[Pop art in the UK](https://www.khanacademy.org/partner-content/tate/global-modernisms/global-pop/a/pop-art-in-the-uk), on the other hand, was fuelled by American culture viewed from a distance. It employed irony and parody in order to focus more on what American popular imagery represented, and its power in manipulating people’s lifestyles. Artists like [Peter Blake](https://www.khanacademy.org/partner-content/tate/global-modernisms/global-pop/v/peter-blake-studio) and [David Hockney](http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artists/david-hockney-1293) created images of their own engagement with American pop culture, while [Patrick Caulfield](https://www.khanacademy.org/partner-content/tate/global-modernisms/global-pop/v/patrick-caulfield) painted everyday objects through a simplified lens. In doing so, he invites us consider the following question (much in the same way [Andy Warhol](http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artists/andy-warhol-2121)'s soup cans do, too): **Can a simple drawing of an everyday object still be a great work of art, and even make you see the world in a different way?**"

msgid "But in the ‘60s, many saw this dominant social order and its endless replication of forms stifling – they rebelled against what they saw as a pre-fab lifestyle, and challenged the political establishment through protesting the Vietnam War, for example. Social movements seeking equality and civil rights for African Americans and women flourished. This spirit of rebellion took root in the art world, too, as many young artists at the time felt that what they were taught at art school and what they saw in museums had little to do with their lives and the culture that surrounded them. In protest, they turned to sources like pop music, product packaging (like the Campbell's soup can), comic books, and Hollywood movies, taking the imagery of mass-production to create art that critiqued and subverted it. And [Pop art](http://www.tate.org.uk/learn/online-resources/glossary/p/pop-art?utm_source=khanacademy.org&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=khan_academy) was born."

msgid "Pop art is an art movement that emerged in the 1950s and flourished in the 1960s, taking inspiration from sources in popular and commercial culture such as advertising, Hollywood movies and pop music. It began as a revolt against the dominant approaches to art and culture and traditional views on what art could (and should) be. Drawing on popular imagery and mass-produced consumer products, Pop art elevated aspects of everyday culture in the middle of the 20th century to the status of art, but the intention was not to glorify those things but to view them with a critical lens through the use of irony and satire."

msgid "Surrounded by the products of consumer culture, American Pop artists were inspired by what they saw and experienced living within that culture. In the United States, the Pop style was seen as a return to representational art, or art that depicted the visual world in a recognisable way. In the previous decades, American post-war art had been dominated by the [Abstract Expressionists](http://www.tate.org.uk/learn/online-resources/glossary/a/abstract-expressionism?utm_source=khanacademy.org&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=khan_academy), who (as their name suggests) used expressive gestures and abstract, non-representational imagery. Faced with a world of consumer “stuff”, Pop artists turned away from that abstraction, instead making use of hard edges and recognisable forms to make art about the visible world around them. By using impersonal, mundane imagery, pop artists also wanted to move away from the emphasis on personal feelings and personal symbolism that characterised abstract expressionism."

msgid "[[☃ image 1]]A post-World War II boom in the economy led to higher salaries and more leisure time, and mass-production led to the creation of objects like televisions, dishwashers, and cars on an unprecedented scale. Hand in hand with new technologies in print production, dissemination, and the rise of the brand-driven advertising industry, each of these consumer goods was sold with the promise of giving their owners fulfilment and satisfaction. With new-found wealth, mobility, and free time, many Americans moved to the suburbs (because homes were mass-produced and widely available, too) and television became the dominant media of the 1950s."

In the United States, the Pop style was seem as a return to representational art, or art that depicted the visual world in a recognisable way. In the previous decades, American post-war art had been dominated by the [Abstract Expressionists](http://www.tate.org.uk/learn/online-resources/glossary/a/abstract-expressionism?utm_source=khanacademy.org&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=khan_academy), who (as their name suggests) used expressive gestures and abstract, non-representational imagery. Faced with a world of consumer “stuff”, Pop artists turned away from that abstraction, instead making use of hard edges and recognisable forms to make art about the visible world around them. By using impersonal, mundane imagery, pop artists also wanted to move away from the emphasis on personal feelings and personal symbolism that characterised abstract expressionism."

But with Japan still reeling from the deployment of the atomic bomb in 1945, Tanaami turned his sights on the culture that was rebuilt in the aftermath of tragedy, and still draws on this subject as he continues to make art: \"Today,\" he says, \"I still create works that deal with my experience of war as a child.

Some Pop artists made use of this visual vocabulary to tell stories of special cultural and social significance, like Iranian sculptor and painter [Parviz Tanavoli](http://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-modern/exhibition/ey-exhibition-world-goes-pop/artist-biography/parviz-tanavoli?utm_source=khanacademy.org&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=khan_academy). Through sculptures, shapes, and symbols evocative of consumer labelling, Tanavoli created playful works – like _The Poet and the Beloved of the King_ (1964-6) – that both told historical and literary stories and spoke to contemporary audiences. Much in the same way, the visual styles of magazines, comic strips, and other printed media were used by Pop artists to speak to and reflect upon the commercialisation of the cultures they lived and work in the world over."

msgid "[[☃ image 1]]America’s influence on fashion, art, music, and technology around the world couldn’t be denied, and many events occurring there – such as the assassination of President John F. Kennedy in 1963 – made waves in the global psyche and art scene. Artists around the world created images in Kennedy's likeness or adopted widely-recognisable motifs like the American flag. Finnish artist [Reimo Reinikainen](http://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-modern/exhibition/ey-exhibition-world-goes-pop/artist-biography/raimo-reinikainen?utm_source=khanacademy.org&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=khan_academy), for example, used the \"stars and stripes\" as a template not for an expression of patriotism but for a comment on the war in Vietnam. With the advent of cheaper air travel and imported television and films, the world felt a growing connectivity with live news and emerging conflicts, and the Pop artists used their work to speak to those events. German artist [Sigmar Polke](http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artists/sigmar-polke-2213?utm_source=khanacademy.org&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=khan_academy) explored a more subtle conflict – that of the Cold War – and the tensions between Communist East and capitalist West Germany, using comic book printing techniques to create images that question the production of desire and the \"buyability\" of satisfaction."

Introduced to painting by family friend [René Magritte](http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artists/rene-magritte-1553?utm_source=khanacademy.org&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=khan_academy), Axell created mixed-media works such as _Valentine_(1966), which was a homage to Valentina Tereshkova, the first woman (and first civilian) to go into space. By attaching elements like helmets and zippers to the canvas, Axell invites her viewer to consider their relationship to the flesh beneath. To highlight the absurdity of Tereshkova's appearance remaining a focus of discussion despite her achievements, Axell staged a complementary performance work in which a model performed a reverse strip-tease: starting naked apart from an astronaut’s helmet, the model added layers of clothing as the performance went on to the delight of the assembled crowd. Acutely aware of working within in a male-dominated industry, her work frequently challenged perceptions of images of the female body and sexuality."

In this social and political climate, artists were uniquely placed to satirise and critique politicians, film stars, and even other artists, using humour, sex and innovation to provoke, parody and reflect."

Men and women artists around the world engaged with Pop in all manner of styles and visual philosophies, with Pop as we know it being prefigured by diverse groups and movements such as [Nouveau Réalisme](http://www.tate.org.uk/learn/online-resources/glossary/n/nouveau-realisme?utm_source=khanacademy.org&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=khan_academy) in France, Concretism in Brazil, [Capitalist Realism](http://www.tate.org.uk/learn/online-resources/glossary/c/capitalist-realism?utm_source=khanacademy.org&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=khan_academy) in Germany, the Japanese avant-garde and the work of [Yayoi Kusama](http://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-modern/exhibition/yayoi-kusama?utm_source=khanacademy.org&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=khan_academy), and [Arte Povera](http://www.tate.org.uk/learn/online-resources/glossary/a/arte-povera?utm_source=khanacademy.org&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=khan_academy) in Italy."

The mesh is always an open structure, never closing–thus maintaining an invitation for the piece to keep growing, and reminding audience members of their own collaborative power. But Meireles had already been harnessing collaboration and circulation as tools, as seen in his _Insertions into Ideological Circuits_ in 1970\\. By printing images and messages onto widely circulated items–like the Brazilian banknote below–he developed a political art project which could criticise the establishment and reach a wide audience while avoiding censorship. After all, who would think to throw away money?"

Her projects confronts the \"completely different reality\" of her new home, which is an intense and visually saturated place, a mix of epochs, scales, and colours. In her film _[Xilitla](http://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-modern/display/melanie-smith?utm_source=khanacademy.org&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=khan_academy)_ (2010)_,_ she captures the strangeness of a modern English garden set within a rainforest. Smith shows us how feelings of alienation and displacement can be great topics for art that explores the fusion of two cultures."

msgid "Modern and contemporary art in Latin America, which stretches from the southern border of the United States to the southernmost tip of South America, has taken many forms, from painting and photography to more subversive sculptures and performances.  While modernism was thriving in 1950s Europe and the United States, Brazilian artist [Geraldo de Barros](http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artists/geraldo-de-barros-14311?utm_source=khanacademy.org&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=khan_academy) was becoming a pioneer of abstract photography in Latin America. During the 1950s he travelled to Europe, training in France and Germany and incorporating painting, graphic, and industrial design into his practice. Prints like _Granada, Spain_ reveal his interest in formal composition and abstraction–traditionally modernist concerns–but the material and the location itself speak to De Barros' personal experience, capturing fragments of his life in urban São Paulo, Granada, and beyond."

msgid "[Abraham Cruzvillegas](http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artists/abraham-cruzvillegas-13142?utm_source=khanacademy.org&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=khan_academy) also draws on Mexican practice and history while bringing it into conversation with other cultures. Like many of their neighbours in Mexico City, Cruzvillegas’ parents built their piecemeal house themselves, adding to it over many decades–a process known as _autoconstrucción_, or \"self-building.\" The artist reflects this process in _AC: Blind Self Portrait: Glasgow-Cove Park_, in which each red-painted object affixed to the wall is some memento from his everyday life, be it a train ticket, note, or drawing made on a restaurant napkin. But many of the objects are also unique to Scotland, where the artist spent several months researching the local economy and materials associated with it. So Cruzvillegas manages to create art that brings two very different places–rural Scotland and Mexico City–into a dialogue on one wall."

As in the sculpture above, the artist focuses most of her work around the experiences of Colombian people whose lives had been damaged by the country’s civil war. During the 1990s, she interviewed the relatives of dead and missing people and did extensive research into the records of humanitarian workers. From these records, she creates sculptures that tell their stories. _Unland: audible in the mouth_ (1998) is a table constructed from two different halves, drilled through with thousands of tiny holes and woven through with a combination of women's hair (sourced from a local Colombian hairdresser) and raw white silk. So the table is an everyday object that has become a vehicle for a particular Colombian story, and a literal fabric of Colombian identity. In this way, artists like Salcedo share their stories with the world through their work."

After a return visit in 1990–her first since the 1979 revolution that brought the Ayatollah Khomeini to power–she was struck by the changes that had taken place in her homeland, including regulations that stated women must cover themselves from head to toe in a veil called _chador._ The veil has since become a major theme of her work, and because of her frequent travels between Iran and the US, she often creates art that comments on the experience of living between two cultures. In her video piece _Soliloquy_–a word that refers to when a dramatic character delivers a speech to him- or herself–two videos are projected on opposite walls of a space. They show a veiled woman, the artist herself, taking parallel journeys in two different cultural landscapes: one in a Middle Eastern city on the edge of the desert and the other in a western metropolis. The action alternates between the two settings, so when the woman on one screen walks from place to place, her counterpart in the other projection stays still, often staring directly at the camera and watching her alter ego on the other screen."

Among artists who embraced and further developed the modernist tradition in the Middle East is [Saloua Raouda Choucair](http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artists/saloua-raouda-choucair-14735?utm_source=khanacademy.org&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=khan_academy), a pioneer in her home country of Lebanon who has only recently achieved well-earned [international recognition](http://www.tate.org.uk/context-comment/articles/life-work-choucair?utm_source=khanacademy.org&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=khan_academy). Through painting and drawing, architecture, textiles and jewellery, as well as a huge range of experimental sculptures like the one below, Choucair works in diverse media pursuing her interests in science, mathematics and Islamic art and poetry. A rare female voice in the Beirut art scene from the 1940s onwards, Choucair’s work combines elements of western abstraction with Islamic aesthetics. It is characterised by an experimental approach to materials alongside an elegant use of modular forms, lines and curves drawn from the traditions of Islamic design."

msgid "Other modern and contemporary artists from the Middle East have used their art to confront more difficult topics, like violence and conflict. Lebanese Palestinian artist [Mona Hatoum](http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artists/mona-hatoum-2365?utm_source=khanacademy.org&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=khan_academy), for example, currently works in London but creates pieces that look back on the conflicts that have shaken both of her homes. [Dia Al-Azzawi](/partner-content/tate/global-modernisms/the-middle-east/v/dia-al-azzawi?utm_source=khanacademy.org&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=khan_academy) is another artist in exile, having moved to the United Kingdom from Iraq in 1976. Al-Azzawi found that by viewing Iraq from afar, by giving himself some personal distance, he could understand more about Iraqi and Arabic culture than if he had remained. The artist's massive drawing _Sabra and Shatila Massacre 1982-3_ is an example of work that arose from this process of long-distance observation. Made in response to the 1982 massacre of Palestinian refugees in Beirut, the drawing was made mostly from Al-Azzawi's imagination using semi-abstract forms, making for a document of the feelings and impressions of tragedy rather than a propaganda piece."

msgid "**[Abstract art](http://www.tate.org.uk/learn/online-resources/glossary/a/abstract-art?utm_source=khanacademy.org&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=khan_academy)**– In a nutshell, abstract art uses shapes, colours, forms, and textures to achieve an effect instead of trying to represent reality as we see it. The word \"abstract\" simply means to withdraw or separate one thing from something else. So if we apply this term to art it would refer to something an artist has made after starting with a visible object and _abstracting_ elements from it to arrive at a new form."

This warlike period saw the British empire expand through the Indian subcontinent and Africa, and strengthen its colonial holdings. As a result, the paintings of this time are imbued with a strong sense of national pride and ambition."

msgid "Later on in the 1700s, artists like [Sir Joshua Reynolds](http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artists/sir-joshua-reynolds-444?utm_source=khanacademy.org&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=khan_academy) sought to elevate their society portraits and they did this in two ways: by making them bigger, and by referencing the old masters of art history and literature. Reynolds and his colleagues had developed this interest in [classicism](http://www.tate.org.uk/learn/online-resources/glossary/c/classicism?utm_source=khanacademy.org&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=khan_academy) and the subjects of the Greek and Roman world following their studies of antiquity in Italy. This was shortly after the discovery of the Roman ruins of Pompeii, along with the publication of a highly influential history of ancient art by German scholar Winckelmann. This period saw paintings that were highly intellectualised, drawing on subjects from classical literature and from ancient Greek dramatists like Euripides. People of the time who looked at these paintings were expected to know how to \"read\" these references–which meant that they were expected to have a classical education. In this way, a great deal of British art of the time was limited to a specific societal class."

msgid "Like the portrait painters who created idealised images of (and for) the upper classes, Italian-born Agostino Brunias painted romanticised visions of a very different world: that of the sugar colonies in the Caribbean. In _Dancing Scene in the West Indies,_ a group of men and women of African and mixed African and European descent dance through the streets to the accompanying music of tambourines and drums, perhaps celebrating a traditional pre-Lent carnival. The figures wear corsets and shirts in combination with headwraps and bare feet in an image of carefree celebration. But the reality of plantation life, and the economic reason for colonisation and the enslavement of people in the Caribbean–the production of sugar and coffee–is not explicitly visible. Brunias sold images like this one to colonial administrators, plantation landowners, and wealthy patrons in London and Paris. By doing so, he perpetuated an idealised image of life on the plantations and enabled those in power to turn a blind eye to the cruel reality of slavery."

The head of the family links hands with his daughters, while the women to the right of the painting are his wives (yes, wives!) This is because the artist has chosen to depict both Sir Richard's current wife (the one seated with a baby) as well as his first wife (lying pale and motionless in the bed), who had died several years before the painting was made. Including both the living and the dead gives the painting an even bigger scope, capturing the entire family dynasty."

msgid "Portraiture continued to be among the most popular types of painting in Britain over the next two centuries. But a period of dramatic change–which saw the Plague of 1665, the Great Fire that decimated most of London in 1666, and a major political revolution–meant that art in Britain changed significantly, too. New genres like [landscape painting](http://www.tate.org.uk/learn/online-resources/glossary/l/landscape?utm_source=khanacademy.org&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=khan_academy), [still life](http://www.tate.org.uk/learn/online-resources/glossary/s/still-life?utm_source=khanacademy.org&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=khan_academy), and decorative painting were brought over and popularised by international artists. Migrants from Europe, like the Flemish [Marcus Gheeraerts II](http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artists/marcus-gheeraerts-ii-206?utm_source=khanacademy.org&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=khan_academy), painted some of the most iconic portraits of Britons and introduced the nation to artistic genres that would shape its cultural heritage for the coming centuries."

msgid "**1.** In this drawing, Turner has captured the image of a cathedral using fine, highly detailed lines. Use a really sharp pencil to copy these carefully drawn details. Try focusing on a small area of the architecture in the centre. You could start from the middle section of one of the spires and take it line by line. Keep looking back to check that the proportion of each mark to the others is the same as in Turner’s work."

msgid "**2.** Although his most famous works deal with land-, sea-, or city-scapes, Turner wasn’t afraid to try his hand at drawing people, too. Drawing figures in proportion is tricky for even the most seasoned artist; Turner practised them over and over again to get them right. Choose one figure you like in the sketch below. Try and follow the outline of the figure without lifting your pencil off the paper, so that you are focusing on the movement of the line."

msgid "**3\\.** This dark and sketchy drawing was probably made quickly and on the spot. Can you see how quickly the lines appear to have been put down? And have you noticed how some marks appear to be lighter than the paper? Turner achieved this by using a mid-tone paper and sketching with pencil, and then adding highlights using white gouache – a thick, opaque paint – and darker areas with a softer pencil and chalk."

msgid "**4.**  Here’s another landscape. This one uses a darker paper and white gouache like the one above, but is made up of curling, dark gestural marks instead. These marks appear very dark because Turner has actually used pen and ink in this case, but you could try using a soft pencil to follow the coil-like lines on the left-hand side. Try and copy the way Turner might have moved his pen. Think of the energy and speed he might have used and how he might have made those curling lines. (Tip: Use your hand from your wrist rather than just from the fingers in order to create a looser line.)"

msgid "In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, copying masterworks was a vital part of a young artist’s education. It allowed students to not only come face to face with great works of art, but to familiarise themselves with the techniques and try their hands at creating in the style of their teachers. As a student himself, Turner spent many evenings copying watercolours, and later in his life made a series of simplified line drawings for his own students to work from."

The group's intentions, according to Maciunas, was to \"promote a revolutionary flood and tide in art, promote living art, anti-art.\" The living art of Fluxus and Kaprow's happenings set the stage for the development of performance art, which moved away from static installations to placing more and more emphasis on the _actions_ of the artists themselves."

The performance artists that worked in the following decades took this dictum to heart, making art through the sheer presence and actions of their bodies in space."

msgid "Performance art has become more than a prompt to consider the nature and function of art–it's often an invitation for its viewers to get involved. Many contemporary performance artists create works that don't just encourage participation but actually rely upon it to exist. [Robert Morris](http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artists/robert-morris-1669?utm_source=khanacademy.org&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=khan_academy)' groundbreaking work _Bodyspacemotionthings_, for example, first took place in 1971 and was among the first fully interactive exhibitions ever staged. Beams, weights, platforms, rollers, tunnels and ramps built from materials such as plywood, stone, steel plate, and rope transformed the gallery space into a physical and visual playground. Without an audience, it was just a jumble of various materials. But with visitors clambering their way through, over, and around, it became a performance in which participation proved itself to be a valuable element of art."

[Roman Ondák](http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artists/roman-ondak-7622?utm_source=khanacademy.org&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=khan_academy)'s works have turned audiences into participants, both willingly as when they volunteered to be measured in _Measuring the Universe_ (2007), and perhaps unwittingly when confronted with a queue waiting for nothing in particular in _Good Feelings in Good Times_(2003)."

Her piece _Rhythm 0_ (1974) was a six-hour performance at Galleria Studio Morra in Naples during which she allowed herself to be manipulated by the public in any way they chose, using a range of objects laid on a table, including hair brushes, feathers, food and even weapons. By doing so, she created a dialogue with the audience, drawing them into artistic territory that was unfamiliar, and even dangerous–the piece only ended after someone held a gun to the artist's head."
