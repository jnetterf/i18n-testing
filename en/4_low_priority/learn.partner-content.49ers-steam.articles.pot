msgid "** Line:** A line is a continuous mark made on a surface which defines the position and direction of a design. Lines are a very important element of art, because in most types of art you need lines to create it. There are a lot of different types of lines and they have names that describe their places in space. There are straight lines, curvy lines, and even zig-zagged lines.  Lines are a very important element in the game of football. Lines can be seen on the field to mark yardage, they are used to align thousands of seats at Levi’s® Stadium, and in the coaches’ playbooks, they are often seen in offensive and defensive plays created to provide direction for player movement and team strategy."

There are countless ways colors and their properties appear in  the game of football, from extravagant banners to the vibrant scoreboard graphics. Every NFL team is identified by different colors and each team has its jersey design and colors related to its organization’s culture. Colors also designate what teams are playing at home or away. 49ers colors are dramatically displayed during home games, where thousands of fans wear their jerseys in support of their hometown team.

msgid "Art can be found in many cultural institutions, like museums, galleries, libraries, churches, and can also be viewed in everyday objects, shapes, and buildings. Have you ever looked around your neighborhood for examples of art? You can see all types of art in roadside sign graphics, in the clothing that people wear, and even in the design of vehicles people drive. From the way people paint their homes to how front lawns are carefully manicured, art can be seen everywhere in the world around you—you just need to know how to look for it. Art can be found wherever your spirit of expression, compassion and communication want to find it. Museums are great places to see a variety of art. For example, the 49ers Museum presented by Sony displays art in a variety of ways. You can see principles of art in hand-sculpted statues and photographs of historic members of the 49ers, in team **pennants** (colorful flags that celebrate a sports team or its achievements) of past eras, in the front-page design of collectible game-day programs, and in the sleek form of the 49ers five Super Bowl trophies. It is also visible on the large screen in the 49ers Morabito Theatre and found in the unique architecture of the museum and Levi’s® Stadium."

"Before we focus on where we see art in football or how football influences art, we must first attempt to define the term. So, what exactly is art? It is very difficult to pinpoint an exact definition of art because it can been seen and interpreted differently by everyone. **Art** may be defined as a human-made expression or creative application of imagination that typically comes in the visual form of photographs, graphics, sculptures, carvings or paintings. Art can be a drawing, digital media, or a collection of miscellaneous items combined to create a three-dimensional work called an **assemblage**. Art can be felt on surfaces, can be heard in nature, or in music, and it is appreciated for its significance, beauty, and in the message it may convey.\n"

msgid "Just like in art, there are principles of design that influence how art is created, perceived, understood and valued. Some of the greatest artwork ever made first came from a basic design. **Design** is the process of deciding how something will be made, including how it will work and what it will look like. Whether it is information (as in the instance of designing a team logo) or function (as in the design of a football helmet), design is a powerful communication device. From the plays in the 49ers playbook to how Levi’s® Stadium was built, design is intricately involved in how the game is watched, played, and marketed. It is probably safe to say that you cannot separate art and design from the attractive aspects of the game of football—that is what makes it so alluring. Elements of art and design visually stimulate fans to continue watching the game with eager anticipation."

msgid "No matter where it is housed or viewed, art helps people develop and share ideas, as well as support them in developing language skills. Looking at and talking about art can also teach you important critical thinking skills like questioning, reflecting, observing, and analyzing. Art gets people talking to each other. What one person sees and feels in a piece of art may be very different than what another person sees.  Art is more than what meets the eye, and it is how you individually interpret or understand what you see, even if it is not recognized or valued in the same way by another person. Art can be appreciated by some, and overlooked by others. Often times, art can trigger a memory or emotion from your own life experiences. The more you are personally involved with the works of art you see, the more interesting and meaningful that art will be."

msgid "Not only can you see art in the plays drawn up, you can also see it the actions and movement in the game. The way a quarterback throws a perfect spiral and completes a fifty yard pass to a receiver despite the opposing team’s pressure and the distracting roar of the crowd, could be perceived as a perfect example of art in play. Football fans can see the beauty and art in the way the game is played and by the forms and actions of players on the field. Football has its own aspects of **aesthetics** (beauty) and creativity, but these aspects alone are not the only reason for it is considered as an art. Because the game of football provides opportunities for self-expression of fans, players and teams alike, the game itself transcends beyond being just another sporting event and allows it to be categorized as an engaging art form."

The 49ers organization and Levi’s® understand that football is a sport that embraces the sights, sounds, colors, and emotions of the game, as well as the culture of the region in where it is played.

The collection includes over two hundred pieces of original artwork created by twenty-three talented local Bay Area artists, and all pieces sharing a common tie to the area and to the 49ers. The various artwork displayed at the stadium was created with acrylic, enamel, oil, and pastel paints, as well as pen, ink, charcoal, stencil, metals, and it even includes various sculptures. This type of art compilation is called mixed media. **Mixed media** is the use of different art materials in the creation of one work or displayed in a collection of various artwork."

msgid "Some people consider the game of football as an art in itself. Just like an artist, it takes skill, commitment and time to become a professional football player. Artists focus on building their skills with each piece they create, which is exactly how professional athletes focus their training on, developing their trade skills. In football, the plays orchestrated on the field can be considered, at times, as nothing short of a master piece. Designing effective football plays can be a real challenge, even for the most experienced coaches. It’s up to coaches to assess their opponent, analyze all the variables involved in the game, and make a well-informed decision on how to design where and how to deploy players in every circumstance. If they design the perfect play and put that play in action, at the right time, and for the right circumstance, it can be a beautiful sight to witness. In a way, the coach’s playbook is much like a painter’s canvas, where they can paint a picture that will help them win the big game. Legendary 49ers coach Bill Walsh designed what is known as the Sprint Right Option play, which led to the most iconic and photographed moment in football history, known as “The Catch,” and ultimately influenced how the game was played in the future.

msgid "The 49ers have been a strong influence on artwork created in the city of San Francisco and the Bay Area, because of the dramatic impact the team and the game has had on its culture. The art celebrates the culture’s love for the team, the game, and the historic moments that the 49ers have provided through the years. The Bay Area region’s interest in 49ers football reaches across generations, gender, geography, gender, and ethnicity. Wherever 49ers fans go and whoever they meet, the game of football can give them something in common—a shared interest. Football can give us a unique insight into American life and culture, and no matter what region you live in, at some level, the culture will share its passion for sports and such passion is reflected in the things they do and celebrate, especially in the art that is created.

msgid "The portrayal of sports in art has been a part of the creative world since its conception. From the Ancient Greek sculptures that display glorified athleticism from the Greek Olympia games, to the countless paintings that have been created portraying iconic athletes of years gone by, art and sports are uniquely joined together. For over a century, art and design have played an important part in American football. Whether seen on a simple scorecard or on a multi-page game program, visual art has always been part of the promotion and celebration of the game. Tickets, posters, football cards, paintings, pocket schedules, and a wide array of other artistic **mediums** (materials used to make an original work of art), are all examples of creative art and design that can be found in football."

A **logo** is a symbol that is used to identify a company and that appears on all of its products. When people see the 49ers logo, the symbolism that the logo provides solicits meaning of pride for the team and the rich history of championship level play, as well as portraying the visual and emotional representation of the 49ers mission statement."

msgid "As you have discovered, geometry is used in many ways. Not only do you see geometry in the shapes and angles found in the architecture of Levi’s® Stadium, but it can also be seen in how the game is played. In the 49ers Museum presented by Sony, you can see geometric angles in the design of the galleries, exhibits, and structural makeup of the building. Without angles, engineers and architects would not have been able to calculate the correct height of the museum’s ceiling or understand the correct angle of lighting to showcase the exhibits."

Football players can even use angles to enhance their individual or team performance. For example, a football placekicker must know what angle to kick the ball at to score a field goal. The path the football will take once it’s kicked comes down to the angle at which it is kicked, the amount of force applied, and the height of the kick. When kicking from thirty yards away, a larger angle is necessary to get the ball through the goalpost. However, when making a fifty yard kick, a shorter angle is called for, so the ball can travel the greater distance to the goal.

msgid "Without understanding math, it is impossible to understand the game  of football: people and objects move in lines and angles,  times are recorded, points are counted, and statistics are calculated. Football players should be interested in the mathematics of the game because it can help them win, and math can help fans better understand how the game is played. Another example of how math influences the game is its relationship to engineering. "

msgid "*Congratulations, you have just been hired by the 49ers as the new Sports Turf Manager & Head Groundskeeping Manager! On the first day of the job, you are already faced with a major challenge. You and your team have to travel to London this summer to support the 49ers in an International Bowl game. Unfortunately, the automatic irrigation system is not working properly and you cannot find anyone to manually water Levi’s® field while you are gone. Your challenge is to design an automated irrigation device that will be able to water the entire field while your team is absent, ensuring that you will give the field the right amount of water, at the right time, without drying it out or flooding it. Remember, it is important to understand the issue to meet your goals, and don’t forget the steps of the engineering design process! Good luck!*"

Engineering and design go hand-in-hand. Many times the solution involves designing something that meets specific criteria or accomplishes a certain task. Design thinking and engineering knowledge and practice come together in many innovations found in professional football.  Many seemingly simple aspects of our daily lives -- as well as various aspects in the game of football -- have been designed and created by engineers. **Engineers** are team players (much like football players) who dream up creative and practical solutions with the ability to change the world for the better. There are various ways to be an engineer, from designing software programs on a tablet for 49ers players to help them study game action, to overseeing maintenance operations for major structures like Levi’s® Stadium. A great deal of engineering work is done through the materials available to engineers and the technology that is present.

It evolved from a watermelon shape to a more aerodynamic **prolate spheroid** -- basically a watermelon shape with pointier ends. The laces, which originally were made just long enough to close the football after the bladder was inserted, became longer and more pronounced to aid players in gripping the ball."

The engineering design process is made of many steps. These steps take place in a certain order, but they are part of a larger cycle that can be repeated. This process helps engineers find a better way to solve a problem or gives them a better direction to improve our world in some way. Below is a breakdown of the engineering design process:"

msgid "The first footballs were made of natural materials, such as an inflated pig bladder, which was later put inside a leather cover. This is why some still call the football \"pigskin\". Today's National Football League (NFL) footballs are made of cowhide leather.  A inflated rubber bladder is what is on the inside of the ball, which is then covered by several layers of leather stitched together, then leather laces are added down one side of the ball to help with the grip of the ball. Modern balls are designed by teams of engineers to exact specifications, with rubber or plastic bladders, and often with plastic covers. They're oblong spheres, 11 to 11.5 inches (27.9 to 29.2 centimeters) long and weighing between 14 and 15 ounces (397 to 425 grams). A valve is on the outside of the ball so you can pump air more easily into the ball's bladder. "

msgid "The inventor of the football glove was John Tate Riddell, and was invented in 1939. When football gloves were first invented, they were used for cold weather and now they're mostly used for grip and protection. Football gloves have now improved in durability, **moisture wicking** (cloth that draws sweat off the skin to the outside of the fabric) capabilities, and in their ability to stick a grab onto a football.  Many receivers wear gloves that either have a sticky rubber palm, called tact gloves, so they can have a better opportunity to catch a ball that is thrown by the quarterback. Linemen also wear gloves for protection. Lineman's gloves have thick padding in them to better protect their fingers and hands. In the past, it has been the practice to protect the hands of many football players, particularly linemen, by taping the hands with conventional adhesive tape, the tape runs across the back of the hand and across the palm. While this taping does offer some protection against injuries, it is less than satisfactory for providing maximum protection. With the invention of the glove, player’s hands have a maximum amount of protection while at the same time providing maximum freedom of movement. Modern sporting equipment engineers are making scientifically-based protective football gloves made out durable, super-light compounds  that absorb impact forces and improve grip."

Structural engineering directly impacts the safety and durability of the buildings and structures we live, work and play in. Structural engineering tells us which resources and materials are useful for structures and how they can be used efficiently. In Levi’s® Stadium, structural engineering helped us accurately estimate safe weight requirements for our stadium stands and it also helped us know  the maximum magnitude of force that our east tower could endure during an earthquake.  By combining safety, functionality and even aesthetics, structural engineering satisfies all needs, including the needs and demand for 49ers fans to go cheer for their favorite football team."

There is also a strong focus on the support of structural systems. Structural engineering involves the application of many subjects, especially science and geometry. Structural engineers study **geometry** -- an area of math that deals with measuring and understanding relationships between points, lines, angles and shapes -- to help them better understand how form applies to structural support.  Throughout history, engineers have used geometric shapes to build famous structures, from the Greek Parthenon in Greece to the Empire State Building in New York City. If you look around your neighborhood, you will see how geometric shapes are used in almost every structure. In the design of Levi’s® Stadium, you will see triangles, squares, rectangles, arches and other geometric forms that reinforce this remarkable structure. "

msgid "Inside the stadium, the primary structural design goal was to bring fans as close to the game as possible. Structural engineers took into account line of sight and sound amplification to magnify cheers from fans during games. The shape on the upper fan deck at Levi’s® Stadium plays a key role in how sound is amplified during 49ers games. The upper and lower decks are essentially large **parabolas**, or curves, that direct the sounds of the fans to the playing field, thus creating higher noise levels during the game. The element of design that creates such increased noise is the overhanging fan decks that reflect sounds back into the stadium. Fans’ cheers reflect off the bottom of the upper deck, and back onto the field. Also, the suite tower on the west side of the stadium has just 35 rows of lower-level seats in front of it. With most of the fans located on the east side, the sound from behind the visiting sideline is expected to hit the suite tower and reflect back to the playing field. This did not happen by accident, but was meticulously planned by structural engineers. 49ers fans now hear a dramatic increase in sound level. And if you’ve ever attended a 49ers game, you know the fans are more energized by the amplified sound, making them cheer even louder."

The Latin root words for structure are *stru* and *struct*, which means “to build.” An **open-air structure** is a shelter or multi-story building which is not enclosed, is designed for event use (like for 49ers games), and has the ability to support a lot of people. **Structures** are systems such as a building or a tower which are built from various parts that support vertical or horizontal loads, or weight. **Structural loads** are forces applied to a structure or its parts. Loads can, at times, cause stress on structures. Overloading a structure can cause harm to the components of the structure or make it fail, so loads are always considered when designing a structure. Levi’s® Stadium supports much of the weight (**load**) of the overlying parts of the building that are created by weight and stress on the sides (**horizontal**), as well as on the top and bottom (**vertical**) of the structure."

msgid "Stadium engineers also utilized trusses in in the design of Levi’s® Stadium to support such loads. The basis of the truss is the use of triangles, the strongest and most rigid geometric shape, in the design of a structure to support the loads (weight) and forces acting on a structure. Trusses are used in a variety of ways in architecture, and are extensively implemented in the design of bridges, buildings (particularly in stadiums), and in tower construction projects that need to support a lot of weight, but also minimize the weight of the structure itself. Trusses utilize the strength of the triangular form in its design because each angle is fixed and held firmly in place by the side opposite it and when a force is applied to the truss, the resulting force is directed sideways rather than down reducing any bending movement that may occur on the beams of a structure. This construction feature allows Levi’s® Stadium to be as stable as can be and effectively support competing loads."

msgid "Structural engineers ensure that large buildings, like Levi’s® Stadium, are strong enough to withstand environmental forces and loads. Because the stadium is located in the Bay Area, where earthquakes are a common occurrence, Levi’s® Stadium engineers had to complete thorough research and testing of its design and material, and design the stadium so that it does not collapse or behave in undesirable ways while hosting the 70,000 49ers fans who attend on a weekly basis during the football season."

msgid "The structures you see in Levi’s® Stadium all came to fruition through the creative application of structural design. Levi’s® Stadium was designed, constructed, and tested by professionals systematically applying their knowledge of the **engineering design process**. The engineering design process brings together various studies and technologies to help solve real world problems or to meet human needs. Often, engineers have to invent products or systems that either never existed before or that improve existing products or systems. Solving problems often takes a multi-step continual process, and most problems have more than one correct solution. As the solution to a problem develops, engineers and designers continually refine their designs to provide the best solution."

msgid "Through vast research and the testing of stadium’s beam materials, practical design solutions were developed to promote safer, more environmentally friendly structures like Levi’s® Stadium. The stadium’s structural engineers worked in teams to perform strength calculations on all of the materials used to construct the stadium, and they supervised the drafting and implementation of its designs. Stadium engineers had to critically test beam and anchor strength to support over 80,000 cubic yards of concrete. A **cubic yard** is the volume of a box that is 1 yard long, 1 yard wide and 1 yard high. **Beams** are horizontal wood or steel pieces spanning a distance between one or more supports, that support weight across the its length. Anchors or **anchorage points** are the connections for both vertical and horizontal beam systems that support a designated weight. A cubic yard of concrete approximately weighs 4,000 lbs., and one ton equals 2,000 pounds. So, the total weight of concrete these beams need to support is 160,000 tons! That equates to about 21,000 full grown elephants--now that is a lot of weight! "

msgid "As helmet design progressed throughout history, some helmets  began to infuse technology that changed how teams communicated. In 1994, professional football enacted a policy that would allow for the installation of an in-helmet radio for quarterbacks. The quarterback could now directly receive a play from the team’s offensive coaching staff, making it possible for offenses to no longer rely on archaic hand-signaling to get the right play to the huddle. Helmet audio has had a direct impact on just about every offensive play, and it drastically improved the hurry-up offense, a strategy that’s highly utilized today. No matter which side of the ball (offense or defense), helmet audio changed how teams plan for and execute plays. This has become an effective communication method for 49ers quarterbacks throughout the years, helping them find continued success on the field."

msgid "At the start of the 20th century, football was just beginning to gain popularity as a college sport. Fans could only experience the game by attending in person, catching the highlights through newspaper articles or by word of mouth. Today, technology saturates our lives, and we can now watch, listen, download, stream, record, playback, and project all aspects of the game through innovations made in technology. Advances in technology have dramatically influenced the game, the way it is played, and have helped to make professional football become America’s most popular pastime."

The word technology is widely used throughout our society; however, the actual meaning of the word is really not that well-known. Technology is frequently associated with gadgetry and gizmos (i.e., cell phones, hand-held game systems, personal computers, etc.) that either entertain or perform a useful function."

msgid "For decades, fans would need to buy a physical ticket to attend 49ers games and would have to stand in line at a ticket office to pick them up. Now, fans can purchase their tickets online and have their virtual e-tickets scanned on their cell phones at the stadium. An **e-ticket**, or electronic ticket, is a reservation, as for a seat in a stadium, for which confirmation is granted electronically in place of a printed ticket. At the start of the 2015 season, the 49ers implemented a paperless ticket initiative for fans attending home games at Levi’s® Stadium. Mobile e-tickets are a huge convenience for both 49ers fans and the ticketing centers. Fans no longer have to worry about forgetting a ticket because it can be stored right on their touch phone."

msgid "However, **technology** is truly defined as the purposeful application of information in the design, creation and utilization of products and services, and can be generally found in the organization of human-made activities. The word technology originates from two Greek words, *techne* and logos. *Techne*  is defined as an art, craft, skill, or the manner by which something is gained. Logos is defined as a word, the means by which inward thought is expressed. Basically, technology means words, discussions and thoughts about the way things are developed or gained."

msgid "One type of technology that we're probably most familiar with today is **electronic technology**, which is a complex form of technology that uses electric circuits to accomplish a specific goal. Anything that runs on electricity -- like computers, smart phones, and even wireless headsets -- is called **electronic**.  A **headset** is a headphone or pair of headphones, usually equipped with a microphone, that allows for two-way communication. 49ers coaches and coordinators started using headsets in 1994, but miscommunications often still occurred during games. This forced coaches to revert back to using hand signals to communicate plays to their quarterbacks from the sidelines. In 2012, professional football ended these sideline technical difficulties by implementing new technology that allowed all teams to switch from the problematic **analog** headsets (which sent communication through wires or cables) to digital wireless headsets.

Irrigating (or watering) the field is an important part of field maintenance, but clean water is a precious resource that could go away if used too much. In the design and construction of Levi’s® Stadium, engineers looked at various options that would allow the stadium to be more efficient with its water usage."

msgid "Irrigation is a process to supplement rainfall artificially. Whenever areas receive 20 inches of precipitation or less (semi-arid climates) annually, irrigation is necessary to ensure continuous plant growth. Football fields have to withstand prolonged periods of wear and tear. It is important to choose the right variety of grass for the playing area based not only on how sturdy it is, but also on how much watering it needs. This is dependent on temperatures prevalent during a playing season. Because of the location of Levi’s® Stadium and the low average amount of rainfall, it is essential to develop an irrigation system that not only keeps the grass healthy, but also manages and recycles the water appropriately. The stadium uses natural Bermuda grass as its playing field which uses 50% less water than other grass options, however, the field still needs to be irrigated and maintained to provide a safe and hearty surface for game use."

msgid "All three types of heat transfer can be demonstrated with one cup of tea. Imagine you are warming up a hot cup of delicious tea. First, you would warm up a cup of tea in a microwave. A microwave oven heats water through radiation. This is how the sun’s radiation reaches the earth. Radiation is solar energy that travels as electromagnetic waves. In this way, energy from the sun reaches the earth. The water molecules vibrate with the waves, and the friction from the motion heats up the tea inside the cup. When the cup of water is removed from the microwave, heat is transferred from the tea to the surrounding air through convection and radiation. In convection, heat travels by actual flow of the warmed fluid (either a liquid or a gas). Convection causes warm air to rise and cool air to fall. If a metal spoon is placed in the tea, the spoon is heated through conduction. Heat travels from the hot to the cold end of the spoon because the hotter molecules are moving at a greater speed. They bump into the cooler molecules and cause them to move faster. As the fast molecules jostle the slow ones, heat moves up the spoon."

Solar power will be the most important part of the design because it is a renewable energy source; the sun has maximum exposure in this geographical area, and will be more cost effective to operate. Your solar stadium will need to keep fans warm during the harsh winters and will need to use the sun’s strong rays to retain that warmth.

You may think that footballs are immune from friction, but the surface on which they roll have a lot to do with how much friction is applied to the football. And of course, gravity has the ability to slow the football down as well.*"

msgid "Forces affect the motion and speed of a football in the game, and different forces can help or hinder motion in the game at different times. Some forces are in direct contact with objects, while other forces are not. For example, the force of friction slows the football down when it rubs against another object. **Friction** is a force that resists motion between two bodies in contact. You can observe friction when you roll a football on the ground. The ball will eventually come to a complete stop after rolling, because the friction caused by the football dragging on the ground depletes the force that was initially enacted upon it."

msgid "In football we often want to maintain contact with a surface to utilize “good” friction to our advantage, but at the same time, we might not want materials heating up or slipping, so players desire to minimize “poor” friction. The ability for a 49ers player to stop immediately on grass turf with cleats would be an example of good friction. The player would need some friction to stop, and to also have the ability of their cleats to grasp the fieldturf to slow down their momentum.  An example of poor friction would be when a 49ers player is not wearing cleats and slips and falls when trying to come to an abrupt stop or change directions quickly. Another example of friction in action can be found in catching a football. The neoprene gloves that receivers wear provide friction on the football by the receiver gripping the ball with its sticky texture. This in turn makes the football slow to a stop and enables the football to be caught."
