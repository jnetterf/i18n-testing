msgid "[[☃ image 1]]Prepare to be shocked at how strong your attraction to these activities might be. They all explore electromagnetism, the area of physics concerned with the interaction of electricity and magnetism—also known as the science of electromagnetic fields. It’s a push me–pull you kind of relationship, where a magnetic field is produced by the motion of electric charges, and electricity is produced by changes in a magnetic field. You can’t have one without the other."

msgid "Modern communications systems, such as long-distance phone lines and high-bandwidth communication lines for computers, commonly use modulated signals carried on a beam of light. The relatively high frequencies of visual light can carry a lot more information than lower frequency radio waves. The light that is used is normally from a laser, not an LED, and the signals are carried by a clear fiber-optic cable, rather than through air, but the principle is the same."

It’s easy to make: just take a quarter head of purple cabbage, place it in a blender with water to cover, and blend until you get a uniform puree. Strain the resulting mixture—the purple liquid you’re left with is your cabbage juice indicator. Dilute it with some water and proceed with the experiment, using it instead of Bromothymol Blue. You will need to experiment with the ratio of water to cabbage juice to see what dilution gives you good results.

msgid "**Legal Disclaimer:** Before 1982, pennies were made of 95% copper, but the rising costs of copper led the United States Mint to change the composition of the penny. The metal content in a pre-1982 penny is actually worth more than its one-cent face value. Consequently, in December 2006, the United States Mint implemented regulations that prohibit the melting or treatment of all one-cent coins. The Exploratorium does not take responsibility for any damaged coinage, and certainly don’t try to sell your battery for more than 5¢!"

"1.  Make a saturated salt solution by adding salt into water until it doesn't dissolve anymore. Add a splash of vinegar to this solution.\n"
"2.  Cut your matboard into four 1/2\" squares, about the size of a penny. Soak the pieces in the salt-and-vinegar solution. Once the pieces are thoroughly wet, take them out and place them on a paper towel so they are still damp, but not dripping.\n"
"3.  Use sandpaper to sand the copper off ONE side of each of four pennies. **Leave the fifth penny intact.** Sand until you see zinc (shiny silver color) covering the entire face of the coin. This takes some time and effort, so be patient. Try placing the sandpaper on a hard surface and moving the penny. The \"tails\" side may be easier to sand because the Lincoln Memorial doesn't protrude as far as Lincoln's head. When you're done, the sanded coins should have a bronze-colored copper side and a silver-colored zinc side.\n"
"4.  Take one of your sanded pennies with the zinc side facing up (copper side down), and place a damp piece of matboard on it. Then stack another sanded penny (again, zinc side facing up) on top of this.\n"
"5.  Take your next piece of matboard and place it on top, and continue stacking pennies and matboard on top of each other to make a neat pile. Finally, place the unsanded penny at the very top. When you're done, you should have alternating layers of pennies and matboard with all the zinc sides facing up, and both the very top and the very bottom of your stack (facing down) should be copper. Make sure the pennies aren't directly touching each other and, likewise, that the pieces of matboard aren't touching each other.\n"
"6.  Test your battery by connecting your LED. Touch the longer lead to the intact penny and the shorter lead to the bottom of the stack. Make sure that the leads don't touch any other layer. Did the LED turn on? If not, try adding an additional sanded penny/soaked matboard layer to the bottom.\n"
"7.  [optional] Check the voltage of the battery with a voltmeter. To keep your LED lit, wrap the entire assembly together with electrical tape. The LED will grow fainter as the matboards dry out, but it should stay lit for 24 hours! To recharge, just re-soak the matboards and reassemble."

msgid "Batteries are devices that convert chemical energy into electrical energy. When two different metals are connected by an electrolyte, a chemical reaction occurs at each metal surface, called electrodes, that either produces or uses electrons. When these electrodes are connected by a wire, electrons will move from one surface to the other, creating an electric current. Pennies that were made after 1982 have zinc cores that are plated with copper. By sanding off one face of a penny, you create a zinc electrode that can pair with the copper electrode on the face of the next penny. The matboard soaked in salty vinegar water serves as the electrolyte between the two terminals. Each zinc-matboard-copper stack represents one individual cell. By stacking additional matboards and sanded pennies, you’ve created a battery, which is a series of electrochemical cells. This is also called a voltaic pile, which is named after Alessandro Volta, who created the first battery in 1800 by alternating zinc and copper electrodes with sulfuric acid between them. In Volta’s battery and your penny battery, an oxidation reaction occurs at the zinc electrode that produces electrons and a reduction reaction occurs at the copper electrode that consumes them."

Be careful not to look directly at the sun, but you can use the spectroscope to look at sunlight reflected off white clouds, white walls, or white paper to see the spectrum of the sun. If you make an excellent top slit on a long tube (24 inches or 60 cm) you may even see thin dark lines in the solar spectrum; these are Fraunhofer lines and reveal what the sun is made of."

msgid "To see what would happen when the wavelength hits the back of the soap film—the line on the right—fold the bottom wave back on itself at the point that it hits the back surface. The drawing on the back of the index card is then displayed and shows the reflected wave. In this experiment, the outgoing and incoming wave lay exactly on top of each other. The exact alignment of incoming and outgoing waves is only true when you position the maximum or minimum point of the wave at the reflecting surface—in this case, the back surface of the soap film."
