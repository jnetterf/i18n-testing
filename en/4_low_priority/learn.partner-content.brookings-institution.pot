msgid "This tutorial introduces the structure of the U.S. health care system, how money flows within it, and an overview of different types of public and private insurance. These videos and questions provide a clear explanation of what is and is not working within the health care system to help frame the health care reform discussion and inform clinicians and the public how to improve quality while decreasing health care spending.  Narrated by Dr. Darshak Sanghavi, a pediatric cardiologist and fellow at Brookings Institution."
