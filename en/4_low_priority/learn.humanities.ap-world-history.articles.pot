Empires often included diverse regions and climates that allowed for a variety of goods to be produced. When these networks were broken or disrupted, empires suffered economically and often lost power or fell entirely."

Many empires created new administrative systems and bureaucracies to oversee and carry out different functions. For example, the Han Dynasty used civil service tests to appoint the most qualified people to government jobs. In the Roman Empire, the emperor appointed people to oversee the road systems and aqueducts. As an empire became very large, it became harder for a central government to oversee all its territory and address all needs."
