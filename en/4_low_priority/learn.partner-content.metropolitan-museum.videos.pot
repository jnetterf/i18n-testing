"<p>Met curator Nicholas Reeves on fragmented history in <em>Head of Tutankhamun</em> from the Amarna Period of Egypt&rsquo;s New Kingdom, c. 1336&ndash;1327 B.C.E.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>This head is a fragment from a statue group that represented the god Amun seated on a throne with the young king Tutankhamun standing or kneeling in front of him. The king&#39;s figure was considerably smaller than that of the god, indicating his subordinate status in the presence of the deity. All that remains of Amun is his right hand, which touches the back of the king&#39;s crown in a gesture that signifies Tutankhamun&#39;s investiture as king. During coronation rituals, various types of crowns were put on the king&#39;s head. The type represented here&mdash;probably a leather helmet with metal disks sewn onto it&mdash;was generally painted blue, and is commonly called the &quot;blue crown.&quot; The ancient name was khepresh.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Statue groups showing a king together with gods had been created since the Old Kingdom, and formal groups relating to the pharaoh&#39;s coronation were dedicated at Karnak by Hatshepsut and other rulers of Dynasty 18. The Metropolitan&#39;s head of Tutankhamun with the hand of Amun is special because of the intimacy with which the subject is treated. The face of the king expresses a touching youthful earnestness, and the hand of the god is raised toward his crown with gentle care.</p>\n"

"<p>Met curator Isabel St&uuml;nkel on precaution in <em>Hippopotamus</em> dating from Egypt&rsquo;s Middle Kingdom,&nbsp;c. 1961&ndash;1878 B.C.E.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>This well-formed statuette of a hippopotamus (popularly called &quot;William&quot;) demonstrates the Egyptian artist&#39;s appreciation for the natural world. It was molded in faience, a ceramic material made of ground quartz. Beneath the blue-green glaze, the body was painted with the outlines of river plants, symbolizing the marshes in which the animal lived.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The seemingly benign appearance that this figurine presents is deceptive. To the ancient Egyptians, the hippopotamus was one of the most dangerous animals in their world. The huge creatures were a hazard for small fishing boats and other rivercraft. The beast might also be encountered on the waterways in the journey to the afterlife. As such, the hippopotamus was a force of nature that needed to be propitiated and controlled, both in this life and the next. This example was one of a pair found in a shaft associated with the tomb chapel of the steward Senbi II at Meir, an Upper Egyptian site about thirty miles south of modern Asyut. Three of its legs have been restored because they were purposely broken to prevent the creature from harming the deceased. The hippo was part of Senbi&#39;s burial equipment, which included a <a href=\"http://www.metmuseum.org/collection/the-collection-online/search/546275\">canopic box</a> (also in the Metropolitan Museum), a coffin, and numerous models of boats and food production.</p>\n"

"<p>Met curator Se&aacute;n Hemingway on the purity of love in <em>Bronze statue of Eros sleeping </em>from Greece&rsquo;s Hellenistic Period, 3rd&ndash;2nd century B.C.E.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The Hellenistic period introduced the accurate characterization of age. Young children enjoyed great favor, whether in mythological form, as baby Herakles or Eros, or in genre scenes, playing with each other or with pets. This Eros, god of love, has been brought down to earth and disarmed, a conception considerably different from that of the powerful, often cruel, and capricious being so often addressed in Archaic poetry. One of the few bronze statues to have survived from antiquity, this figure of a plump baby in relaxed pose conveys a sense of the immediacy and naturalistic detail that the medium of bronze made possible. He is clearly based on firsthand observation. The support on which the god rests is a modern addition, but the work originally would have had a separate base, most likely of stone.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>This statue is the finest example of its kind. Judging from the large number of extant replicas, the type was popular in Hellenistic and, especially, Roman times. In the Roman period, Sleeping Eros statues decorated villa gardens and fountains. Their function in the Hellenistic period is less clear. They may have been used as dedications within a sanctuary of Aphrodite or possibly may have been erected in a public park or private, even royal, garden.</p>\n"

"<p>Met curator Carmen Bambach on the presence of genius in Michelangelo Buonarroti&rsquo;s <em>Studies for the Libyan Sibyl (recto); Studies for the Libyan Sibyl and a small Sketch for a Seated Figure (verso),&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>c.&nbsp;1510&ndash;11.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>This is the most magnificent drawing by Michelangelo in the United States. A male studio assistant posed for the anatomical study, which was preparatory for the Libyan Sibyl, one of the female seers frescoed on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel (Vatican Palace) in 1508-12. In the fresco, the figure is clothed except for her powerful shoulders and arms, and has an elaborately braided coiffure. Michelangelo used the present sheet to explore the elements that were crucial in the elegant resolution of the figure&#39;s pose, especially the counterpoint twist of shoulders and hips and the manner of weight-bearing on her toe. Recent research shows that this sheet of studies was owned by the Buonarroti family soon after Michelangelo&#39;s death. The &quot;no. 21&quot; inscribed on the verso of the sheet (at lower center) fits precisely into a numerical sequence found on many other drawings by the artist that have this early Buonarroti family provenance.</p>\n"

"<p>Met curator Ian Alteveer on reticence in Jasper Johns&rsquo;s <em>White Flag,</em> 1955.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Born in Augusta, Georgia, in 1930 and raised in South Carolina, Jasper Johns moved in 1949 to New York City, where he enrolled in a commercial art school for two semesters. Back in New York, following his service in the army (ca. 1950&ndash;51), Johns became acquainted with artist Robert Rauschenberg, composer John Cage, and dancer Merce Cunningham. By the mid- to late 1950s Johns had already achieved fame with his paintings of targets, numerals, and American flags, and his work was exhibited in prominent museums and galleries in New York. &quot;White Flag&quot; of 1955, recently acquired by the Metropolitan from the artist&#39;s own collection, exemplifies Johns&#39;s early style, which engendered a wide range of subsequent art movements, among them Pop Art, Minimal Art, and Conceptual Art. During the 1950s and 1960s Johns frequently appropriated well-known images (such as targets, flags, and beer cans), elevating them to cultural icons. Throughout his oeuvre &mdash; which includes painting, prints, drawings, and sculpture &mdash; images are constantly recycled and combined in extensive series. In his later compositions of the 1970s, Johns filled the surface of his pictures with colorful cross-hatchings (suggested by the passing cars on an expressway); and since the 1980s he has incorporated images that have more autobiographical significance.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>&quot;White Flag&quot; is the largest of his flag paintings and the first in which the flag is presented in monochrome. By draining most of the color from the flag but leaving subtle gradations in tone, the artist shifts our attention from the familiarity of the image to the way in which it is made. &quot;White Flag&quot; is painted on three separate panels: the stars, the seven upper stripes to the right of the stars, and the longer stripes below. Johns worked on each panel separately. After applying a ground of unbleached beeswax, he built up the stars, the negative areas around them, and the stripes with applications of collage&mdash;cut or torn pieces of newsprint, other papers, and bits of fabric. He dipped these into molten beeswax and adhered them to the surface. He then joined the three panels and overpainted them with more beeswax mixed with pigments, adding touches of white oil.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The fast-setting medium of encaustic enabled Johns to make each brushstroke distinct, while the forty-eight-star flag design&mdash;contiguous with the perimeters of the canvas&mdash; provided a structure for the richly varied surface, which ranges from translucent to opaque.</p>\n"

His grandfather, Alexander Milne Calder (1846-1923), studied with Thomas Eakins and is famous for the elaborate sculptural decorations of Philadelphia&#39;s City Hall. Calder himself had studied to be an engineer at the Stevens Institute of Technology before attending the Art Students League in New York. Like many aspiring artists of his generation, Calder then spent time in Paris where he was inspired by Joan Mir&oacute;&#39;s work and absorbed the playfulness of Dada. Indeed, it was the French artist Marcel Duchamp who christened Calder&#39;s hanging sculptures &quot;mobiles.&quot; For works such as this one, Calder cut sheet metal into various shapes and assembled these elements in a chain-linked system so that the flat metal pieces move in response to currents of air.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>This particular mobile was included in the 1942 exhibition &quot;Artists for Victory&quot; at the Metropolitan where the sculpture committee awarded it a prize and recommended it be added to the collection.</p>\n"

"<p>Met curator Ya&euml;lle Biro on humanity in <em>Seated Figure</em> by the Djenn&eacute; peoples of Mali and the Inland Niger Delta region.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>This haunting figure huddles with its leg hugged to its chest and its head dropped on its knee. It simultaneously suggests the knotted tension of anxiety and the sublime absorption of deep prayer. Created over 700 years ago, in the Inland Niger Delta region of present-day Mali, this elegant work&#39;s intense emotional immediacy blurs the boundaries of time and place.&nbsp;This terracotta sculpture comes from a site called Jenne-jeno, the oldest known city in sub-Saharan Africa. Jenne-jeno flourished in the ninth century C.E., but declined and was abandoned by 1400. Items of cast brass and forged iron, clay vessels, and figures like this one survive. They testify to what scholars contend was a richly varied and highly sophisticated urban society.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>A few controlled archaeological digs provide only the vaguest outlines of the original significance of the art of this time and region. Recovered terracotta figures are frequently quite detailed. They include jewelry, clothing, and body ornaments such as the parallel columns of bumps and circles on the back of this work. Sometimes they cover the entire body and seem to represent the pustules of some dreadful illness. Sculptures like this one may represent ancestors or mythic characters, or might have served as guardians. Here, the figure&#39;s shaved head and attitude of introspection resemble mourning customs still practiced by many cultures in sub-Saharan Africa. It is possible that the earlier peoples of the Inland Niger Delta had similar ritual methods to express grief over the death of loved ones.</p>\n"

"<p>Met curator Joanne Pillsbury on immortality in <em>Mask,</em>&nbsp;10th&ndash;6th century B.C.E<em>.,&nbsp;</em>by the Olmec peoples of ancient Mexico.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Depicting a typical Olmec face with slanted, almond-shaped eyes and a toothless, slightly downturned mouth, this mask is rendered with simplicity and elegance. Its harmonious proportions are indicative of the sophistication attained by Olmec sculptors. The smooth, highly polished planes of cheek, forehead, and chin plus the almost fleshy quality of the nose and parted lips belie the incredible hardness of the jadeite cobble from which the mask was made. The face itself is neither human nor supernatural but, rather, an idealized type that incorporates otherworldly aspects&mdash;such as the mouth, with its reference to the so-called were-jaguar, a powerful mythic being with human and jaguar traits.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Masks of this size in stone have not been excavated in archaeological sites and it is difficult to determine their function. Lacking holes for eyes and nose, it could not have been worn over a living face, but there are attachment holes along the edges by means of which it might have been used as a costume element or adhered as a face to a mummy or a sacred bundle. There is a polished, circular depression on the back of the mask.</p>\n"

"<p>Met curator Sin&eacute;ad Vilbar on inner conflict in <em>Fudō Myōō (Achala-vidyaraja)</em> dating from Japan&rsquo;s Heian period, 12th century.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Fudō Myōō is the most widely represented of the Buddhist deities known as Myōō, or Kings of Brightness. A fierce protector of the Buddhist Law, he is a direct emanation of the Buddha Dainichi Nyorai, the principal Buddha of Esoteric Buddhism. The first sculptures of Fudō made in Japan were seated, but standing sculptures like this one were carved beginning in the eleventh century. Fudō uses his sword to cut through ignorance and his lasso to reign in those who would block the path to enlightenment. The heavy weight of the shoulders and back is planted firmly on the stiffened legs, appropriate for a deity whose name means the &ldquo;Immovable.&rdquo;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Images of Fudō are often housed in temple halls called Gomadō where a fire-burning ritual called the goma-e is performed. The ritual involves the burning of incense and other possessions to symbolically destroy defilements. This statue, originally composed of six hollowed-out pieces of wood, was formerly the central icon of the Kuhonji Gomadō in Funasaka, twenty miles northwest of Kyoto. The hall has not survived. Fudō would once have had a mandorla carved in the shape of wild flames and inserted behind him into the rock upon which he stands.</p>\n"

"<p>Met curator Denise Leidy on ugliness and divinity in <em>Arhat (Luohan)</em> dating from China&rsquo;s Liao dynasty, &nbsp;c. 1000.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>This nearly life-size sculpture and its <a href=\"http://www.metmuseum.org/collection/the-collection-online/search/42722\">companion piece</a>&nbsp;are part of a group of about sixteen works that have been known in the West since 1913. They are thought to have come from a cave in Yixian, in Hebei province, and they represent arhats (or luohans, as they are known in China). Arhats were thought to have achieved an advanced (although not perfected) state of spiritual development, and they eventually became recognized as protectors of Buddhism. Both works are justifiably acclaimed as masterpieces of ceramic sculpture, both for their size and for the quality of their glaze, a three-toned or colored glaze known as sancai. The discovery of an ancient kiln in a village near Beijing in 1983 and its subsequent excavation in 1985 yielded much information that could be used to date these extraordinary sculptures. It seems reasonable, therefore, to date the more technically challenging, life-size works slightly later, probably to the late tenth or eleventh century.</p>\n"

"<p>Fang Congyi, a Daoist priest from Jiangxi, traveled extensively in the north before settling down at the seat of the Orthodox Unity Daoist church, the Shangqing Temple on Mount Longhu (Dragon Tiger Mountain), Jiangxi province. Imbued with Daoist mysticism, he painted landscapes that &quot;turned the shapeless into shapes and returned things that have shapes to the shapeless.&quot;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>According to Daoist geomantic beliefs, a powerful life energy pulsates through mountain ranges and watercourses in patterns known as longmo (dragon veins). In Cloudy Mountains, the painter&#39;s kinetic brushwork, wound up as if in a whirlwind, charges the mountains with an expressive liveliness that defies their physical structure. The great mountain range, weightless and dematerialized, resembles a dragon ascending into the clouds.</p>\n"

"<p>Met curator Eric Kjellgren on communication in <em>Slit Gong (Atingting kon) </em>by the Tin Mweleun peoples of Ambrym Island in Vanuatu,&nbsp;mid to late 1960s.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The towering slit gongs of northern Vanuatu are among the largest musical instruments in the world. Found primarily on Ambrym, Malekula, and neighboring islands, they are carved from the trunks of breadfruit trees, which are also an important food source. In each village, a number of gongs, comprising a sort of informal orchestra, stand on the village dancing ground. Gong orchestras are played at major social and religious events such as initiations, funerals, and dances. When playing, the musician stands in front of the gong and strikes the lip of the slit with a clublike wooden beater. As the gong ensemble is played, rhythms of immense variety and complexity can be produced by the carefully coordinated actions of multiple drummers.</p>\n"

"<p>Met curator John Carpenter on perception in Kohei Nawa&rsquo;s <em>PixCell-Deer#24, </em>2011.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>This taxidermied deer has been completely transformed through the artist&rsquo;s use of variably sized &ldquo;PixCell&rdquo; beads, a term he invented. PixCell is a portmanteau word combining the idea of a &ldquo;cell&rdquo; with that of a &ldquo;pixel,&rdquo; the smallest unit of a digital image. Whether intentionally or unintentionally on the artist&rsquo;s part, PixCell-Deer#24 resonates with a type of religious painting known as a Kasuga Deer Mandala, which features a deer&mdash;the messenger animal of Shinto deities&mdash;posed similarly with its head turned to the side, and with a round sacred mirror on its back. For Japanese artists the deer was depicted often as a companion of ancient sages and had auspicious or poetic associations.</p>\n"

"<p>Aristotle (384&ndash;322 B.C.E.) rests his hand reflectively on a bust of Homer, the blind epic poet of the <em>Iliad</em> and the <em>Odyssey</em>. A medallion representing Alexander the Great, whom Aristotle tutored, hangs from the heavy gold chain. The philosopher contemplates material rewards as opposed to spiritual values, with the play of light and shadow on his features suggesting the motions of his mind. Painted for the great Sicilian collector Antonio Ruffo, the picture also refers to Aristotle&#39;s comparison of touch and sight as a means of acquiring knowledge.&nbsp;</p>\n"

"<p>Met curator Perrin Stein on subjectivity in Jacques-Louis David&rsquo;s <em>Study for The Lictors Bringing Brutus the Bodies of his Sons, </em>1787.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>This sheet is a compositional study for <em>The Lictors Bringing Brutus the Bodies of his Sons</em> (Mus&eacute;e du Louvre, Paris), painted by David on the eve of the French Revolution and exhibited shortly after the Fall of the Bastille. As with many of his iconic Neoclassical canvases, the subject was drawn from Roman history but found great resonance in the context of contemporary events. The canvas depicts an episode from the life of Lucius Junius Brutus, who put to an end the brutal r&eacute;gime of Tarquin, Rome&rsquo;s last king, and established the first Roman Empire, only to later find his two sons embroiled in a royalist conspiracy. True to his political convictions, Brutus condemned his sons to death. The novelty of David&rsquo;s painting is its focus, not on the executions, but on the wrenching domestic aftermath.&nbsp;David&rsquo;s Neoclassical style is fully formed here and can be seen in the clean geometry of the architectural setting, the arrangement of the figures in a relief-like plane, the linear treatment of the forms, and the cool monochrome palette. The poses of the main figures, from the brooding Brutus cast in shadow at the left, to his anguished wife and daughters to the right, as well as the furniture and accessories, are all based on antiquities copied by the artist while he was a student in Rome.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>Completed by late 1408 or early 1409, probably in Paris, &quot;The Belles Heures,&quot; a private devotional book, was the first of two sumptuous manuscripts commissioned by the duke of Berry from the Limbourg brothers, Pol, Jean, and Herman. It is the only manuscript that they completed in its entirety. The other manuscript, &quot;The Tr&egrave;s Riches Heures,&quot; was left incomplete at the brothers&#39; deaths in 1416. The richly illustrated text is amplified by unusual cycles reflecting the duke&#39;s personal interests. Using a luminous palette, the artists blended an intimate Northern vision of nature with Italianate modes of figural articulation. The keen interest in the natural world and the naturalistic means of representing it, so striking in ninety-four full-page and fifty-four column illuminations, foreshadow the work of Jan van Eyck and the ensuing generations of outstanding fifteenth-century painters in the South Netherlands.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>This splendid Last Supper is part of a series of four tapestries illustrating the Passion of Christ. They were designed by Bernard van Orley, a leading artist in sixteenth-century Brussels, the preeminent center for tapestry manufacture in this period. The work exemplifies van Orley&rsquo;s integration of Northern traditions and Italian models to develop a new tapestry style. He combined the expressive emotion and penchant for detail found in Albrecht D&uuml;rer&rsquo;s Last Supper woodcut, which inspired the tapestry&rsquo;s compositional arrangement, with Raphael&rsquo;s monumental figures and spatial construction. Raphael&rsquo;s cartoons for the tapestry series Acts of the Apostles, commissioned for the Sistine Chapel and sent to Brussels to be woven, were significant models for van Orley and other Flemish artists, providing a paradigm of the grand, heroic narrative style of contemporary Roman art. In the Last Supper, populated by muscular, rhetorically gesturing figures engaged in a moment of high drama, van Orley fully realized tapestry&#39;s potential for emulating monumental painting.<br />\n"

"<p>Met curator Freyda Spira on advertising in Albrecht D&uuml;rer&rsquo;s <em>Adam and Eve,</em> 1504.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Throughout his life, D&uuml;rer was in thrall to the idea that the perfect human form corresponded to a system of proportion and measurements and could be generated by using such a system. Near the end of his life, he wrote several books codifying his theories, including the Underweysung der Messung (Manual of measurement), published in 1525, and Vier B&uuml;cher von menschlichen Proportion (Four books of human proportion), published in 1528 just after his death. D&uuml;rer&#39;s fascination with ideal form is manifest in Adam and Eve. The first man and woman are shown in nearly symmetrical idealized poses: each with the weight on one leg, the other leg bent, and each with one arm angled slightly upward from the elbow and somewhat away from the body. The figure of Adam is reminiscent of the Hellenistic Apollo Belvedere, excavated in Italy late in the fifteenth century. The first engravings of the sculpture were not made until well after 1504, but D&uuml;rer must have seen a drawing of it. D&uuml;rer was a complete master of engraving by 1504: human and snake skin, animal fur, and tree bark and leaves are rendered distinctively. The branch Adam holds is of the mountain ash, the Tree of Life, while the fig, of which Eve has broken off a branch, is from the forbidden Tree of Knowledge. Four of the animals represent the medieval idea of the four temperaments: the cat is choleric, the rabbit sanguine, the ox phlegmatic, and the elk melancholic.</p>\n"

"Gossart was among the first northern artists to travel to Rome to make copies after antique sculpture and introduce historical and mythological subjects with erotic nude figures into the mainstream of northern painting. Most often credited with successfully assimilating Italian Renaissance style into northern European art of the early sixteenth century, he is the pivotal Old Master who changed the course of Flemish art from the Medieval craft tradition of its founder, Jan van Eyck (c. 1380/90--1441), and charted new territory that eventually led to the great age of Peter Paul Rubens (1577--1640).<br />\n"

"Conservators, scientists, and curators tell the story behind the unprecedented conservation of Tullio Lombardo&#39;s <em>Adam</em>.<br />\n"
"<br />\n"
"The life-size marble statue of <a href=\"http://www.metmuseum.org/collection/the-collection-online/search/197822\">Adam</a>, carved by Tullio Lombardo (Italian, ca. 1455&ndash;1532), is among the most important works of art from Renaissance Venice to be found outside that city today. Made in the early 1490s for the tomb of Doge Andrea Vendramin, it is the only signed sculpture from that monumental complex. The serene, idealized figure, inspired by ancient sculpture, is deceptively complex. Carefully manipulating composition and finish, Tullio created God&#39;s perfect human being, but also the anxious victim of the serpent&#39;s wiles.\n"
"\n"
"<p>In 2002, Adam was gravely damaged in an accident. Committed to returning it to public view, the Museum undertook a conservation treatment that has restored the sculpture to its original appearance to the fullest extent possible.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The exhibition allows Adam to be viewed in the round and explains this unprecedented twelve-year research and conservation project. It also inaugurates a new permanent gallery for Venetian and northern Italian sculpture. The installation of this gallery was made possible by Assunta Sommella Peluso, Ignazio Peluso, Ada Peluso, and Romano I. Peluso.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>This gemlike work demonstrates both Shitao&rsquo;s mastery of the album format and his ability to innovate within it. Landscape scenes alternate with tightly cropped floral vignettes, taking the viewer on a rollercoaster ride with each turn of the page. Shitao&rsquo;s calligraphy, too, changes with each leaf, seeming to mirror the shifts in content and style. The artist created this work after he had abandoned his dream of finding fame in Beijing and returned south to become a professional painter. The journey, which begins in the first leaf with a landscape scene, culminates in leaf five, with a man in a boat&mdash;almost certainly Shitao himself&mdash;passing through a desolate river landscape, before finding resolution in the final image of a single narcissus.</p>\n"

"<p>Met curator J. Kenneth Moore on gratitude in Goto Teijo&rsquo;s Koto,&nbsp;c.&nbsp;1440&ndash;1512.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>This rare acquisition is a tour de force of Japanese decorative and musical arts that is currently unparalleled in this country. Although a strong tradition existed before then, the foundation for modern Japanese koto music were formed during the seventeenth century. This koto, with it copious inlay and remarkable metalwork by Teijo, ninth master and perhaps most skilled member of the famous Goto family of metalwork artists, documents this important musical development. It also reflects the status of its owner and the koto&#39;s role as a symbol of Japan. All but the instrument&#39;s playing areas are exceptionally decorated. Gold crane medallions set against a finely carved diaper pattern adorn the sides, which are framed in a virtuosic rendering of inlaid woods, horn, ivory, and wire that extends onto both the upper and lower surfaces. The ends, of tagayasan and shitan wood, are embellished with geometric inlay patterns and metalwork lions and flowers in ivory frames. The elaborate black lacquered outer case, dating from the early nineteenth century, is decorated with gold makai-e cranes (symbol of the Karasumaru family) and geese, and its interior is lined with gold foil patterned with flying geese. The cloth wrap is composed of two silk embroidered fabrics of eighteenth- and nineteenth-century origin.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>Throughout his career, Delacroix was inspired by the novels of Sir Walter Scott, a favorite author of the French Romantics. This painting depicts a scene from Ivanhoe: the Jewish heroine Rebecca, who had been confined in the castle of Front de Boeuf (seen in flames), is carried off by two Saracen slaves commanded by the covetous Christian knight Bois-Guilbert. The contorted, interlocking poses and compacted space, which shifts abruptly from the elevated foregound to the fortress behind, create a sense of intense drama. Apart from the still life at lower left, the only element of calm is Rebecca herself.</p>\n"

"<p>Met curator Bradley Strauchen-Scherer on intuition in Bartolomeo Cristofori&rsquo;s <em>Grand Piano</em>, 1720.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Bartolomeo Cristofori was the first person to create a successful hammer-action keyboard instrument and, accordingly, deserves to be credited as the inventor of the piano. This example is the oldest of the three extant pianos by Cristofori. About 1700 he began to work on an instrument on which the player could achieve changes in loudness solely by changing the force with which the keys were struck. By 1700 he had made at least one successful instrument, which he called &quot;gravicembalo col piano e forte&quot; (harpsichord with soft and loud). His instrument still generally resembles a harpsichord, though its case is thicker and the quill mechanism has been replaced by a hammer mechanism. Cristofori&#39;s hammer mechanism is so well designed and made that no other of comparable sensitivity and reliability was devised for another seventy-five years. In fact, the highly complex action of the modern piano may be traced directly to his original conception.</p>\n"

"<p>Met curator Charles Little on miraculous beauty in <em>Relief of the Betrayal and Arrest of Jesus</em>, made in Amiens, Picardy, France.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Four key events in the final hours of Jesus&rsquo; life are dramatically shown here (from left to right): Peter sheathing his sword after severing the ear of Malchus (seated), the high priest&rsquo;s servant; Jesus miraculously restoring the ear; Judas betraying Jesus with a kiss; and Roman soldiers arresting Jesus. The compression of these events into one scene with its complex interweaving of figural masses creates a powerful sculptural statement.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In the medieval church the choir screen separated the nave and the choir area. By the thirteenth century these barriers often were decorated with extensive narrative themes, especially the Passion, the dramatic final events in the earthly life of Jesus. Because they hindered participation in church rituals by the laity, most European churches eventually eliminated them. The choir screen at the cathedral in Amiens was destroyed in 1755. This relief is one of the largest and best preserved narrative sculptures to survive.</p>\n"

"<p>Met curator Peter Barnet on theatricality in <em>Plaque with the Journey to Emmaus and Noli Me Tangere, </em>c.&nbsp;1115&ndash;20<em>.</em></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Two appearances of the risen Christ are represented on this ivory plaque. Christ&#39;s encounter with two disciples on the road from Jerusalem to Emmaus is depicted at the top. According to the Gospel of Luke, the disciples, &quot;their faces full of gloom,&quot; lamented Christ&#39;s crucifixion to a stranger they met on the road. Knowing that he was not recognized, Christ explained that it was preordained that the Messiah must suffer in order to redeem humankind (Luke 24:13-27). The figures are not placed in an illusionistic setting but are portrayed against a neutral background. The travelers are equipped with appropriate traveling gear&mdash;staff, water gourd, and purse&mdash;and their spirited discussion is emphasized by their lively stride.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In the lower register, Christ appears to Mary Magdalene, who, according to the Gospel of John, stood weeping outside Jesus&#39; empty tomb. Seeing Christ and thinking he was the gardener, she said, &quot;If it you, sir, who removed him, tell me where you have laid him, and I will take him away.&quot; Jesus said, &quot;Mary!&quot; She turned to him and said, &quot;Rabbuni!&quot; (Hebrew for &quot;My Master&quot;). Jesus said, &quot;Noli me tangere [Do not touch me] for I have not as yet ascended to the Father&quot; (John 20:11-17). The drama of both these narratives is effectively conveyed through the vigorous, elongated bodies, gesturing heads, and large hands. The swirling drapery with pearled borders similarly emphasizes the action. The plaque was part of a larger composition representing scenes from the life of Christ, but its context remains unknown.</p>\n"

"<p>Met curator Luke Syson on faith in Antonio Rossellino&rsquo;s <em>Madonna and Child with Angels,&nbsp;</em>c. 1455&ndash;60<em>.</em></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Antonio Rossellino was among the most gifted sculptors of his generation, and his reliefs of the Virgin and Child are justly celebrated. This example, carved from mottled brown marble about 1455&ndash;60, is particularly successful. The Virgin sits on an elaborate throne, with scrolled armrests projecting in high relief. Both she and the Christ Child in her arms seem strangely subdued, perhaps contemplating Christ&#39;s future suffering. The protective, caressing gesture of the Virgin&#39;s left hand is especially poignant.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The surface is richly contoured and decorated, and the concern for finish extends to the background, which is enlivened by the heads and feathery wings of seraphim. Typical of painters of the period is the sculptor&#39;s attention to ornamental detail: the fringe of the Virgin&#39;s mantle, the haloes, and the strands of hair of both Virgin and Child are delicately highlighted with touches of gilding.</p>\n"

"<p>Met curator Diana Craig Patch on language without words in <em>Cult Image of the God Ptah</em>, dating from Egypt&rsquo;s Third Intermediate Period, c. 945&ndash;600 B.C.E.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>This statuette depicts Ptah, the chief god of Egypt&#39;s capital city Memphis, who is easy to identify by his tight-fitting cap and enveloping shroud. Other iconographic details, such as the royal beard, the large and detailed broad collar, the scepter of merged &quot;was&quot; and &quot;djed&quot; signs, and a platform representing the hieroglyph for universal order, as well as the brilliant blue stone, communicate four important epithets: Lord of Lower Egypt, Master Craftsman, Lord of Truth, and Lord of the Sky.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The superior carving of the god&#39;s face, scepter, and jewelry is astonishing for a piece of such diminutive size and hard stone. Its style and quality suggests the sculpture was made in a royal workshop and most likely intended for use as a votive piece in Ptah&#39;s large temple at Memphis or in a small shrine dedicated to the god elsewhere in Egypt.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>This unusually large red-chalk drawing by Rembrandt is closely based on an early print after Leonardo da Vinci&#39;s famous mural of the Last Supper in Santa Maria delle Grazia, Milan. Far from slavishly replicating his model, Rembrandt has recast all the figures, intensifying their reactions to Christ&#39;s words, and has condensed the space they occupy. The Lehman sheet is one of three drawings by Rembrandt based on Leonardo&#39;s &quot;Last Supper,&quot; a work that profoundly captured his imagination.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>Images of the pensive bodhisattva were produced throughout Asia. In Korea, the type emerged as an important Buddhist icon during the sixth and seventh centuries, particularly in the kingdoms of Baekje and Silla. This seated figure is among the best preserved and most spectacular. It is infused with a subtle yet palpable energy that is articulated in details such as the pliant and lifelike fingers and toes. The deity&rsquo;s braided hair has a dramatic linear pattern. His crown is topped with an orb-and-crescent motif, indicating Central Asian influence.</p>\n"

"<p>This enameled plaque originally crowned the top of a large, double-sided altar cross. With chalk-white faces and deep brows, the angels mournfully bear witness to the Crucifixion of Jesus.

"<p>Met curator Keith Christiansen on timelessness in Berlinghiero&rsquo;s <em>Madonna and Child.</em></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Of exceptional beauty and importance, this painting may date to the 1230s and is one of only two works that can be confidently assigned to Berlinghiero, the leading painter in Lucca. It follows the Byzantine type known as the Hodegetria (&quot;She who shows the way&quot;), familiar from icons that arrived in Italy following the fall of Constantinople in 1204. The Madonna points to Jesus as the way to salvation; dressed like an ancient philosopher, he holds a scroll. One scholar has noted: &quot;Berlinghiero&rsquo;s work operates with nuances . . . These nuances include the proportions of the figures, the interplay of their bodies and halos, and the language of gestures, with their gentle flow and their subtle meaning on both human and theological levels.&quot;</p>\n"

"<p>Met curator Andrea Bayer on liberation in Jacopo Bassano&rsquo;s <em>The Baptism of Christ, </em>c. 1590.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>This extraordinary picture&mdash;deeply expressive and almost unique in showing the Baptism of Christ as occurring late at night&mdash;is the last known work by the great Venetian painter Jacopo Bassano, who left it unfinished when he died in 1592. It was viewed by his heirs as his artistic testament and was retained by them for more than a century. To our eyes, the altarpiece&rsquo;s unfinished&mdash;or &quot;non finito&quot;&mdash;style seems a crucial step towards modernism, to be compared with, for example, Goya&#39;s &quot;black paintings.&quot; Bassano explores an expressive intensity&mdash;dark in mood as in the palette&mdash;that is a direct and deeply personal response to Titian&#39;s late pictures. He interprets the baptism of Christ not as a sunny event in a pastoral landscape but as the tragic opening of Christ&#39;s Passion.</p>\n"

"<p>Met curator Catharine Roehrig on realism in <em>Statue of an Offering Bearer</em> dating from Egypt&rsquo;s Middle Kingdom, c. 1981&ndash;1975 B.C.E.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>This masterpiece of Egyptian wood carving was discovered in a hidden chamber at the side of the passage leading into the rock cut tomb of the royal chief steward Meketre, who began his career under King Nebhepetre Mentuhotep II of Dynasty 11 and continued to serve successive kings into the early years of Dynasty 12. Together with a second, very similar female figure (now in the Egyptian Museum, Cairo) this statue flanked the group of twenty two models of gardens, workshops, boats, and a funeral procession that were crammed into the chamber&#39;s narrow space.&nbsp;Striding forward with her left leg, the woman carries on her head a basket filled with cuts of meat. In her right hand she holds a live duck by its wings. The figure&#39;s iconography is well known from reliefs of the Old Kingdom in which rows of offering bearers were depicted. Place names were often written beside these figures identifying them as personifications of estates that would provide sustenance for the spirit of the tomb owner in perpetuity. The woman is richly adorned with jewelry and wears a dress decorated with a pattern of feathers, the kind of garment often associated with goddesses. Thus, this figure and its companion in Cairo may also be associated with the funerary goddesses Isis and Nephthys who are often depicted at the foot and head of coffins, protecting the deceased.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>All the accessible rooms in the tomb of Meketre had been plundered in ancient times, but, early in 1920, the Museum&#39;s excavator, Herbert Winlock had his workmen clean out the accumulated debris in order to obtain an accurate floor plan of the tomb. It was during this cleaning operation that the small hidden chamber was discovered, filled with its almost perfectly preserved models and the two statues. In the division of finds between the Egyptian Government and the Metropolitan Museum, half of the contents went to the Egyptian Museum in Cairo, and half came to New York.</p>\n"

"<p>Met curator Donald La Rocca on cultural continuity in <em>Saddle (gser sga)</em> from Derge, Tibet,&nbsp;c. 1942&ndash;46.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Like the Surkhang saddle also in the Metropolitan Museum&#39;s collection (<a href=\"http://www.metmuseum.org/collection/the-collection-online/search/27964\">acc. no. 2005.427.1</a>), this example demonstrates that the long tradition of finely made and ornately decorated ceremonial saddles flourished in Tibet until the mid-twentieth century. This saddle is distinguished by elaborate mounts of intricately modeled gilt copper set with turquoise. It was made in Derge (in present-day Ganzi Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Sichuan Province, China), famous for centuries for its metalwork. It is rare and important as a fine example of high-quality, late Derge metalwork made for a known patron: the Tibetan nobleman Yuthok Tashi Dundrup (1906&ndash;1983) commissioned the saddle when he assumed the post of govornor of Eastern Tibet in 1942.</p>\n"

"<p>Met curator Jan Glier Reeder on the element of surprise in Charles James&rsquo;s <em>Evening Dress, </em>1946.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Charles James produced some of the most memorable garments ever made. He began his design career in the 1930s. It peaked between the late 1940s and mid- 1950s, when his scarce and highly original gowns were sought after by society&#39;s most prominent women. Personally draping and constructing the garments that bear his label, he is considered to be the only American to work in the true couture tradition. James saw himself as an artist and sculptor of dress rather than a dressmaker. He manipulated fabrics into dramatic shapes using complex seaming and sometimes complicated understructures to create his singular vision of timeless elegance. A master of the relationship between form, color and texture, he often heightened the drama of his evening wear by combining several like fabrics of different colors, or different fabrics in like colors but with different light reflective qualities. Also a perfectionist, he worked for years on refining certain seam lines, shapes and constructs that particularly expressed his vision of artistry through rigorous engineering. Many of his pieces are conceived asymmetrically and possess a sense of movement and vitality that is a signature characteristic of his work. Many historical references in shapes and construction, especially the drapery forms of the 1870s and early teens, are also prevalent throughout his work.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The construction of this dress reconfigures the body by having the harder draped fabric brought forward and soft fabric at the back, the opposite from the norm, giving the appearance of front and back being reversed. The startling color contrast and different reflective qualities of satin, wool-backed crepe and faille in the skirt reinforce this deception. The form of the hips bears witness to James&#39; claims of being a sculptor of fabric.</p>\n"

"<p>Met curator Julie Jones on intrigue in <em>Nose Ornament with Spiders</em> from ancient Peru,&nbsp;1st century B.C.E.&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;2nd century, C.E.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Nose ornaments are among the earliest jewelry forms in Precolumbian America and were made in an endless variety of materials and styles; those for the elite were made of precious metal. In Peru, nose ornaments became less fashionable in the second half of the first millennium A.D. and were seldom used after about 600. This elegant, very delicate crescent nose ring from northern Peru is evidence of the high level of craftsmanship that existed among metalworkers at this time. Depicted are four spiders sitting in their web. The openwork, lacelike quality of the object was achieved by fusing the many minute parts together to create a symmetrical composition. The stylized spiders, their tiny eyes and fangs showing, are held, each in its own open space, by paired, spindly legs echoing the round bodies and joined to the web.&nbsp;Spider imagery occurs in Peruvian art from the middle of the first millennium B.C.E. onward, suggesting that spiders played a role in early Andean mythology. The spiders&#39; ability to catch and kill live prey associates them with sacrifice. Information from the sixteenth-century Inka peoples links spiders with rainfall and fertility.</p>\n"

"<p>Met curator Fiona Kidd on portable wealth in <em>Clasp with an eagle and its prey</em>&nbsp;dating from the Parthian Empire, c. &nbsp;1st&ndash;2nd century, C.E.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>This solid gold ornament is in the form of a roundel with two projecting elements that have slots for the attachment of a strap. The rim of the roundel, consisting of eighteen thumbnail-shaped cells for turquoise inlay in the manner of some Sarmatian roundels, frames the openwork figure of an eagle in high relief. Grasping a small, crouching animal in its talons, the bird perches in three-quarter view, facing right, with its chest extended and the rest of its body receding into the background. Its wings are outspread, the one on the left seen emerging from behind the swelling of the chest and the one on the right receding into the back plane. The body and legs carry ridges and linear patterning to suggest the texture of feathers. The bird&#39;s head is in profile, with a cell for the prominent ear, a protrusion at the eye area, a curved beak, and a downcurved line for the mouth. The entire figure is worked in the round, although the back is distorted and not as carefully finished as the front.&nbsp;The eagle&#39;s prey has been variously identified as an antelope, a goat, and a hare. Turquoise is inlaid in its large ear and in several places on its body. The tabs on either side of the roundel have cells for inlays at the corners in the form of debased acanthus leaves.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>This piece is one of a pair; its mate, in the British Museum, London, depicts an eagle facing the opposite way. It was thought by Ernst Herzfeld to be part of a treasure found in 1910&ndash;11 in a chamber tomb near Nihavend in Iran. Herzfeld speculated that this trove had belonged to an aristocratic Parthian family and had originally included a group of Roman gold coins of the first to second century C.E.&nbsp;that surfaced independently in modern times. Another related piece of jewelry, found in excavations at Dalverzin Tepe in Iran, can be dated archaeologically to the first century C.E.</p>\n"

"<p>Met curator Amelia Peck on modern living in Frank Lloyd Wright&rsquo;s <em>Living room from the Little House, Wayzata, Minnesota,&nbsp;</em>1912&ndash;15.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The Frank Lloyd Wright Room was originally the living room of the summer residence of Frances W. Little, designed and built between 1912 and 1914 in Wayzata, Minnesota, a suburb of Minneapolis. The room epitomizes Wright&#39;s concept of &quot;organic architecture,&quot; in which the building, setting, interior, and furnishings are inextricably related. The house is composed of a group of low pavilions interspersed with gardens and terraces, which, in plan, radiate from a central symbolic hearth.&nbsp;The Frank Lloyd Wright Room also exemplifies one of Wright&#39;s most important contributions to modern architecture: the idea of spatial continuity. Low overhanging roofs and geometric window &quot;grilles&quot; with stylized plant motifs once linked the interior visually and spatially to the wooded site overlooking Lake Minnetonka. The living room itself is not merely a single, enclosed volume but a series of horizontal levels surrounded by glass, which allows the interplay of natural light and the rich, earthy tones that Wright employed throughout the room.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>This room achieves tonal harmony through the combination of ocher plaster walls, natural oak trim and flooring, the use of the exterior reddish brown bricks for the fireplace, and leaded windows with an electroplated copper finish. The bold forms of the oak furniture were likewise conceived as an integral part of the composition. The center of the room is empty and furniture groupings enliven the peripheral space. Many of the accessories are similar to those original to the room, and others recall objects that appear in period photographs. The use of Japanese prints and natural flower arrangements are characteristic Wright touches.</p>\n"

"<p>Met curator Alisa LaGamma on ancestral worship and mortality in <em>Figure from a Reliquary Ensemble: Seated Female </em>by the Fang peoples of Gabon or Equatorial Guinea,&nbsp;19th&ndash;early 20th century.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The Fang peoples derive a sense of continuity with their past as well as a communal cohesiveness in the present through an ancestral cult known as bieri. Bieri reliquary figures, such as this 19th century example, embody the qualities that the Fang admire most in people&mdash;namely, tranquility, vitality, and the ability to hold opposites in balance. Such wooden figures and heads are placed on top of bark containers that hold the precious relics of important clan ancestors. The carved head or figure mounted on top of the reliquary box guards the sacred contents against the forbidden gaze of women and uninitiated boys. Before being removed from Africa, such works were invariably separated from the relic containers that they originally enhanced.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>This formidable female figure personifies controlled exuberance. Despite her contemplative expression, her being exudes vitality and boundless physical dynamism. The eyes are defined as deeply incised pupils within expansive recesses. These concave passages are echoed in the round at the summit of the forehead by the bold globular projections of the coiffure elements. This regal and original arrangement of hair is highly detailed. Several contiguous crests extend across the crown of the head and are gathered in a single vertical tress at the nape of the neck.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The Fang sculptor, who lucidly articulated this figure as a series of discrete component elements, integrated them masterfully into a seamless form to stunning effect. The pronounced ovoid volume of the head is abruptly juxtaposed with the broad columnar neck. At the outer corner of each eye a deep arc extends to the bridge of the nose. The nostrils are slightly flared, and the open mouth is cast as a broad oval. Especially alluring is the effect of the shimmering highlights that glance off the luminous midnight black wood, which is thoroughly saturated with oil. Another arresting visual accent is provided by the pendent oval breasts. These do not appear as sensuous elements but rather as overt attributes of power. Their formal definition complements the muscular curves of the physiognomy, so that they are echoed in the successively larger cylindrical units of the shoulders, upper arms, and forearms. The arms are bent at the elbows, hands held in front of the body in a pose suggesting arrested animation.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Positioned as freestanding with slightly flexed knees, the figure appears to shift her weight slightly to the proper right side. The fact that she was originally conceived as seated is apparent from the extreme abbreviation of the powerful thighs, when seen frontally, in contrast to the full forms of the elongated calves. On the reverse side the vertical channel of the spine extends the length of the back and intersects with the horizontal passage of the buttocks. The original patrons sought to repair a break to the proper left shoulderaffixing horizontal metal bands with five nails to the front and reverse side. Two brass rings appear around the neck as well as one around the proper left wrist and each ankle.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>This work was owned successively by two members of the Western avant-garde, Andr&eacute; Derain and Jacob Epstein.&nbsp;<br />\n"

"<p>Met curator Marsha Hill on reverence in <em>Statue of two men and a boy that served as a domestic icon</em> dating from the Amarna Period of Egypt&rsquo;s New Kingdom,&nbsp;c. 1353&ndash;1336 B.C.E.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>All of the individuals in this small group are males, represented according to the conventions of Amarna art. The intriguing group has been variously interpreted as a family comprising a grandfather, a father, and a son, or as one man at three different stages of life. The latter is most unlikely as the multiple representations of a single individual in one statue are not shown interacting as they do here. In fact careful examination of the faces and figures points to the fact that the statue is a kind of domestic icon. The figure at left is a high-status individual and likely the oldest; he is probably a revered relative or the respected overlord of the man and boy who stand closely entwined with one another. The statuette would probably have received veneration in the household of its owner while he was a student in Rome.<br />\n"

"<p>Met curator Ellenor Alcorn on the creative moment in <em>Ewer</em>, a work of Chinese porcelain with English mounts,&nbsp;1573&ndash;1620; mounts c. 1585.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In the sixteenth century Chinese porcelain was occasionally brought to England, sometimes by way of the Levant, sometimes by sea around the Cape of Good Hope. As it was very rare and considered a special treasure, the most accomplished English silversmiths were often commissioned to make mounts for it. Pieces such as these were regarded as suitable for royal gifts or for the furnishing of princely houses.&nbsp;The ewer shown here is one of a group of Chinese porcelains of the Wan Li period (1575&ndash;1619) with silver-gilt mounts made by an unidentified English silversmith about 1585. They were all acquired by the Museum from the estate of J.P. Morgan.</p>\n"

"<p>Met curator Kiki Karoglou on dangerous beauty in <em>Marble capital and finial in the form of a sphinx</em> dating from the Attic period of ancient Greece, ca. 530 B.C.E.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>This capital and sphinx originally crowned the tall grave marker of a youth and a little girl on view in this gallery. A plaster copy has been set on the monument itself.&nbsp;The sphinx, a mythological creature with a lion&#39;s body and a human head, was known in various forms throughout the eastern Mediterranean region from the Bronze Age onward. The Greeks represented it as a winged female and often placed its image on grave monuments as guardian of the dead. This sphinx, which retains abundant traces of red, black, and blue pigment, was carved separately from the capital on which it stands. Its plinth was let into a socket at the top of the capital and secured by a metal dowel and a bed of molten lead. The capital is in the form of two double volutes (spiral scrolls) designed like a lyre. The front face of the capital also had a painted design of palmettes and volutes.</p>\n"

"<p>Met curator Jason Sun on the pursuit of beauty in <em>Figure of a Seated Court Lady</em> dating from China&rsquo;s Tang dynasty, 8th century.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>This charming figure brings to life a moment of leisure at the Tang imperial court. The plump young lady sits in a relaxed pose, accompanied by a playful lapdog next to her slipper. Bright, clear-toned glazes&mdash;a recent innovation in ceramic technology&mdash;enhance the beauty of her clothes with striking colors, amber yellow for her jacket and bright green for her sash and skirts. The hourglass-shaped stool, originally made of rattan, points to the trade and exchange with South Asia during this prosperous and cosmopolitan age.&nbsp;This classic example of Tang sculpture illustrates the artistic sophistication of figural representation in the eighth century, when Chinese artists first mastered the skills to represent the human form in the round and with naturalistic details, which they adopted from the West through Buddhist art. At the same time, they maintained a certain degree of the Chinese linear tradition, as shown in the rhythmic drapery folds.</p>\n"

"<p>Met curator Elizabeth Cleland on starting over in <em>Hunters in a Landscape</em>, partly based on a woodcut by Jost Amman and woven anonymously by Flemish weavers, c. 1575&ndash;95.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>This extremely rare hanging combines an exquisitely well-preserved palette with the distinctive long and narrow format of a wainscot tapestry. In a style referred to by Flemish weavers at the time as &quot;English fashion,&quot;&nbsp;it was intended to hang between the cornice and the dado of a wood-paneled room. The tapestry is attributed on stylistic, iconographic and technical grounds to Flemish immigrant weavers who sought refuge from the religious tumult of the era by relocating to England, probably London.&nbsp;In excellent condition, it is a particularly engaging example of the output of this fascinating and only recently studied diaspora of weavers from Flanders. The tapestry is notable for its weavers&#39; remarkable use of color in the construction of forms and effects of light and cast shadow. The idyllic landscape contrasts vistas of pastoral relaxation with a hunting scene, flanking a central moated building.&nbsp;</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>In this, his greatest surviving landscape, El Greco portrays the city he lived and worked in for most of his life. The painting belongs to the tradition of emblematic city views, rather than a faithful documentary description. The view of the eastern section of Toledo from the north would have excluded the cathedral, which the artist therefore imaginatively moved to the left of the Alc&aacute;zar (the royal palace). Other buildings represented in the painting include the ancient Alc&aacute;ntara Bridge, and on the other side of the river Tagus, the Castle of San Servando.<br />\n"

"<p>Met curator Clare Vincent on art and science in Gerhard Emmoser&rsquo;s <em>Celestial globe with clockwork, </em>1579.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>This globe houses a movement made by Gerhard Emmoser, imperial clockmaker from 1566 until his death in 1584, who signed and dated the meridian ring. The movement, which has been extensively rebuilt, rotated in the celestial sphere and drove a small image of the sun along the path of the ecliptic. The hour was indicated on a dial mounted at the top of the globe&#39;s axis and the day of the year appeared on a calendar rotating in the instrument&#39;s horizon ring. The silver globe, with its exquisitely engraved constellations and Pegasus support, is the work of an anonymous goldsmith who was probably employed in the imperial workshops in Vienna or Prague.</p>\n"

"<p>Met curator Doug Eklund on teenage irreverence in Dan Rochford&rsquo;s <em>Girls I Have Known.</em></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The invention and mass marketing of Kodak cameras in the late 1880s transformed photography into an everyday activity. By the turn of the century, amateurs everywhere were filling album pages with the fruits of their own labors.&nbsp;Mass-media imagery suited the album format just as well. Sparked by advancements in photomechanical reproduction, a profusion of new illustrated magazines began to appear just after the turn of the century. This, in tandem with a burgeoning film industry&mdash;well off the ground by 1910&mdash;wrought dramatic changes in public perceptions of fame, sophistication, and ideal beauty.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><em>Girls I Have Known</em>, compiled by Daniel Rochford when he was sixteen, stands at the crossroads of these various cultural and technological currents. This eccentric scrapbook-filled with handwritten commentary, folded notes passed in school, and snapshot portraits&mdash;documents the &quot;girls&quot; the author has liked (and disliked), from his first kindergarten &quot;crushes&quot; to later, unrequited high-school romances. More than an example of oddball juvenilia, <em>Girls I Have Known</em> is a testament to photography&#39;s signal importance in the structuring of mass desire at the dawn of the media age.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>These exquisite paintings, juxtaposing Christ&#39;s sacrifice for the salvation of mankind with the Last Judgment, are by Jan van Eyck, the most celebrated painter of fifteenth-century Europe, and an assistant. The Crucifixion is presented as an eyewitness account set against a distant landscape, astonishing for its depth and subtlety of description. By contrast, the Last Judgment is organized hieratically in three tiers, with the scale of the figures manipulated to indicate their relative importance. The biblical texts on the original frames relate specifically to the scenes depicted, establishing a play between word and image that would have been admired by contemporaries.</p>\n"

"<p>Met curator Sarah B. Graff on life force in <em>Two Panels with striding lions</em> from Babylon, c. 604&ndash;562 B.C.E.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The Assyrian Empire fell before the combined onslaughts of Babylonians and Medes in 614 and 612 B.C. In the empire&#39;s final days, Nabopolassar (r. 625&ndash;605 B.C.), who had been in Assyrian service, established a new dynasty with its capital in Babylon. During the reign of his son, Nebuchadnezzar II (r. 604&ndash;562 B.C.), the Neo-Babylonian empire reached its peak. This was largely attributable to Nebuchadnezzar&#39;s ability as a statesman and general. He maintained friendly relations with the Medes in the east while vying successfully with Egypt for the control of trade on the eastern Mediterranean coast. He is well known as the biblical conqueror who deported the Jews to Babylon after the capture of Jerusalem.&nbsp;During this period Babylon became the city of splendor described by Herodotus and the Old Testament Book of Daniel. Because stone is rare in southern Mesopotamia, molded glazed bricks were used for building and Babylon became a city of brilliant color. Relief figures in white, black, blue, red, and yellow decorated the city&#39;s gates and buildings.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The most important street in Babylon was the Processional Way, leading from the inner city through the Ishtar Gate to the Bit Akitu, or &quot;House of the New Year&#39;s Festival.&quot; The Ishtar Gate, built by Nebuchadnezzar II, was a glazed-brick structure decorated with figures of bulls and dragons, symbols of the weather god Adad and of Marduk. North of the gate the roadway was lined with glazed figures of striding lions. This relief of a lion, the animal associated with Ishtar, goddess of love and war, served to protect the street; its repeated design served as a guide for the ritual processions from the city to the temple.</p>\n"

"<p>Met curator Kim Benzel on repetition in <em>Relief panel</em> from Assyria,&nbsp;&nbsp;c.&nbsp;883&ndash;859 B.C.E.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The palace rooms at Nimrud were decorated with large stone slabs carved in low relief, with brightly painted walls and ceilings and sculptural figures guarding the doorways. The throne room contained narrative scenes commemorating the military victories of Ashurnasirpal, while in other areas of the palace were protective figures and images of the king and his retinue performing ritual acts.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>On this relief slab the king Ashurnasirpal II wears the royal crown, a conical cap with a small peak and a long diadem. He holds a bow, a symbol of his authority, and a ceremonial bowl. Facing him, a eunuch, a &quot;beardless one,&quot; carries a fly whisk and a ladle for replenishing the royal vessel. The peaceful, perhaps religious character of the scene is reflected in the dignified composure of the figures.</p>\n"

"<p>Met curator Adela Oppenheim on emptiness in <em>Pectoral and Necklace of Sithathoryunet with the Name of Senwosret II </em>dating from Egypt&rsquo;s Middle Kingdom, c. 1887&ndash;1878 B.C.E.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>This pectoral is composed around the throne name of King Senwosret II. It was found among the jewelry of Princess Sithathoryunet in a special niche of her underground tomb beside the pyramid of Senwosret II at Lahun. Hieroglyphic signs make up the design, and the whole may be read: &quot;The god of the rising sun grants life and dominion over all that the sun encircles for one million one hundred thousand years [i.e., eternity] to King Khakheperre [Senwosret II].&quot;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>This cloisonn&eacute; pectoral is inlaid with 372 carefully cut pieces of semiprecious stones. The heraldic design is replete with symbolism. Zigzag lines on the base bar represent the primordial waters out of which the primeval hill emerged. Each of the falcons, symbols of the sun god, clasps a circular hieroglyph meaning &quot;encircled,&quot; thus declaring the solar deity&#39;s supreme power over the universe. The same hieroglyph, elongated to form a cartouche, encircles the throne name of Senwosret II, Khakheperre. Flanking the king&#39;s name are two ankh hieroglyphs (meaning &quot;life&quot;) suspended from cobras whose tails are wound around the sun disk on the falcons&#39; heads. These snakes represent Nekhbet and Udjo, the traditional protector goddesses of the king. Supporting the royal cartouche is the kneeling god Heh clutching two palm ribs symbolizing &quot;millions of years.&quot; Thus the king&#39;s life and existence in time are described as part of a universe created and sustained by the supreme sun god.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Jewelry worn by royal women during the Middle Kingdom was not simply for adornment or an indication of status but was also symbolic of concepts and myths surrounding Egyptian royalty. Jewelry imbued a royal woman with superhuman powers and thus enabled her to support the king in his role as guarantor of divine order on earth. It was essentially the king who benefited from the magical powers inherent in the jewelry worn by the female members of his family, which explains why his name, rather than that of the princess, appears in the designs.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Since the tomb of the princess was beside the pyramid of Senwosret, scholars speculate that she was his daughter. Other items in the tomb bear the name of Amenemhat III, suggesting that the princess lived during the reigns of three of the most powerful rulers of Dynasty 12: Senwosret II, Senwosret III, and Amenemhat III.</p>\n"

"<p>Met curator Wolfram Koeppe on lasting monuments in <em>Alexander Danilovich Menshikov,</em> an 18th-century Russian portrait bust created by an anonymous artist, c. 1703&ndash;4.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The pictorial program of this intriguing portrait reflects the sitter&#39;s meteoric rise as a military commander and his personal search for a pedigree. The oval reliefs show the Justice of Trajan (right) and Alexander the Great and Hephaestion at the tent of Darius (left). Hephaestion&#39;s friendship with Alexander (who happened to share a first name with Menshikov) is meant to underscore Menshikov&#39;s service to his master and close friend, Peter the Great. After the emperor&#39;s death in 1725, his widow, Catherine, assumed power and virtually entrusted Menshikov with ruling Russia. Upon her death in 1727, Menshikov&#39;s opponents instigated a political rebellion. Menshikov, who had been knighted in 1703 and received the rank of prince in 1705, was stripped of his possessions and title and exiled to northern Siberia, where he died in poverty.</p>\n"

"<p>Met curator Janice Kamrin on anonymity in <em>Canopic Jar with a Lid in the Shape of a Royal Woman&rsquo;s Head </em>from Egypt&rsquo;s Valley of the Kings, c. 1349&ndash;1336 B.C.E. or shortly thereafter.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Although this canopic jar was intended for a funerary context, the face on the lid was carved by a master with the skill and care one might expect in a more public portrait. Whatever the age of the owner at her death, she was given a youthful countenance for the eternal afterlife. The shape of the face, with its long slender nose, sloe eyes, and sensuous mouth, identifies it as a product of the latter half of the Amarna period. The jar and lid were altered in antiquity, making it extremely difficult to identify the original owner.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The striking face carved on the jar lid represents one of the royal women of Amarna. Her hairstyle of overlapping curls, known as the Nubian wig, was worn only by adults and was popular among the female members of Akhenaten&#39;s family. The hole at the center of the forehead once secured the separately carved upper body of a rearing cobra whose tail is visible across the top of the wig. This royal protector was exclusively worn by kings and queens.&nbsp;Since its discovery in 1907, the face has been variously identified as that of Queen Tiye, Akhenaten&#39;s mother; Queen Nefertiti, his principal wife; Queen Kiya, his beloved secondary wife; and Princess Merytaten, his eldest daughter. For a time, it was even identified as Akhenaten himself. This confusion is understandable, since the inscription identifying the owner was almost completely erased. Faint traces of hieroglyphs indicate that the jar was originally inscribed for Kiya, and the Nubian wig is most frequently associated with this queen. In some respects, however, the face more closely resembles later representations of Tiye, and it is possible that the lid originally belonged to her burial equipment and was later placed on Kiya&#39;s canopic jar.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The tomb in which the jar was found, KV 55 in the Valley of the Kings, is probably the most controversial of all Egyptian tombs. It contained burial equipment inscribed for Queen Tiye and magical bricks with the name of Akhenaten. There were also four canopic jars (including this one) and an inlaid wooden coffin almost certainly made for Kiya. It appears that, for safekeeping, Tutankhamun had this material transferred to Thebes from Akhenaten&#39;s tomb at Amarna, which seems to have been plundered soon after Akhenaten&#39;s death. The jars and coffin of Kiya may have been reused at that time for the burial of another member of the royal family.</p>\n"

"<p>Met curator Maryam Ekhtiar on contradiction in <em>Goa Stone and Gold Case </em>from Goa, India, late 17th&ndash;early 18th century.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>&quot;Goa stones&quot; were manufactured by Jesuit priests living in Goa, a small province on India&rsquo;s western coast. They are manmade versions of bezoars (a mixture of gallstones and hairs found in the stomach of deer, sheep, and antelopes) that, when scraped and ingested with tea or water, were supposed to have medicinal properties. Elaborate containers of gold or silver were made for them and they were exported to Europe. An ogival trellis containing a variety of beasts, including unicorns and griffins, overlays the container. The source of these images is likely to have come to Goa through Portuguese influence in the region.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>The head is ancient but from another statue. Restorations by the eighteenth-century Italian sculptor Vincenzo Pacetti: (on Dionysos) ivy wreath, neck, both arms, lower right leg, calf and boot of left leg, hanging drapery on right side; (on the archaistic image) uplifted corner of drapery, both arms, lower half of lower legs, feet, pedestal, entire base.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Dionysos, god of wine and divine intoxication, wears a panther skin over his short chiton and his high sandals with animal heads on the overhanging skin flaps. He&nbsp;stands beside an archaistic female image whose pose and dress imitate those of Greek statues carved in the sixth century B.C.E. It is difficult to know whether the original Greek bronze statue of Dionysos, of which this is a copy, included the female figure. Supports in the form of pillars, herms, and small statues were not uncommon in Classical art, but this figure may have been added to support the outstretched arm and may represent Spes, a Roman personification of Hope, who was commonly shown as an archaistic maiden.</p>\n"

"<p>Met curator Dani&euml;lle Kisluk-Grosheide on identity in Jean-Fran&ccedil;ois Oeben&rsquo;s <em>Mechanical table,&nbsp;</em>c. 1761&ndash;63.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Long recognized as one of Jean-Fran&ccedil;ois Oeben&#39;s masterpieces, this table (ca. 1761&ndash;63) was made for his frequent and most important client, Madame de Pompadour. The main charge of her coat of arms, a tower, appears at the top of the gilt-bronze mount at each corner. The marquetry of the top&mdash;one of the finest panels in all of Oeben&#39;s furniture&mdash;was designed to reflect her interests in the arts and depicts a vase of flowers as well as trophies emblematic of architecture, painting, music, and gardening. The table, completed after Oeben&#39;s death by his brother-in-law Roger Vandercruse, demonstrates Oeben&#39;s talents, not only as a creator of beautiful furniture but also as a mechanic: an elaborate mechanism allows the top to slide back at the same time as the larger drawer moves forward, thereby doubling the surface area.</p>\n"

"<p>Met curator Helen Evans on climax in the Byzantine <em>Plate with the Battle of David and Goliath,&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>629&ndash;30.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In 628&ndash;29 the Byzantine emperor Herakleios (reigned&nbsp;610&ndash;41) successfully ended a long, costly war with Persia and regained Jerusalem, Egypt, and other Byzantine territory. Silver stamps dating to 613&ndash;29/30 on the reverse of these masterpieces place their manufacture in Herakleios&rsquo;s reign. The biblical figures on the plates wear the costume of the early Byzantine court, suggesting to the viewer that, like Saul and David, the Byzantine emperor was a ruler chosen by God. Elaborate dishes used for display at banquets were common in the late Roman and early Byzantine world; generally decorated with classical themes, these objects conveyed wealth, social status, and learning. This set of silver plates may be the earliest surviving example of the use of biblical scenes for such displays. Their intended arrangement may have closely followed the biblical order of the events, and their display may have conformed to the shape of a Christogram, or monogram for the name of Christ.&nbsp;At the top of this magnificent plate, David confronts Goliath, and between them is a personification of the river from which David gathered stones for his sling. The major scene shows the decisive battle. Although David appears to be on the defensive, his men move forward, forcing Goliath&rsquo;s soldiers into retreat. At the bottom, the victorious David beheads the giant (1 Samuel 17:41&ndash;51).</p>\n"

"<p>Met associate director Carrie Rebora Barratt on leadership in John Trumbull&rsquo;s <em>The Sortie Made by the Garrison of Gibraltar,&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>1789.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>This painting depicts the events of the night of November 26, 1781, when British troops, long besieged by Spanish forces at Gibraltar, made a sortie, or sudden attack, against the encroaching enemy batteries. The focal point of the painting is the tragic death of the Spanish officer Don Jose de Barboza. Abandoned by his fleeing troops, he charged the attacking column alone, fell mortally wounded, and, refusing all assistance, died near his post. Trumbull portrays him rejecting the aid of General George Eliott, commander of the British troops. This work, the largest and last of three versions of the subject that Trumbull executed between 1786 and 1789, demonstrates his ambition to solidify his reputation on the basis of the highly respected genre of history painting.<br />\n"

"<br />\n"
"Remington&rsquo;s ambitious group includes five horses and four riders: two American cavalrymen, from the United States Regiment of Dragoons, and two Plains Indians. The Dragoons, who patrolled the land west of the Mississippi River, have closed in on the fleeing Indians, and the men are locked in hand-to-hand combat. While the soldiers&rsquo; uniforms, rifles, and accoutrements are historically correct for 1850, Remington&rsquo;s Indians are closer in type to those he had known in the West in the 1880s and 1890s.</p>\n"

"<p>Elegant furniture incorporating intriguing mechanical devices was a trademark of the Roentgen workshop, which from 1768 until about 1793 was one of Europe&#39;s most successful cabinetmaking enterprises. The distinguished design and the innovative way prefabricated elements such as the detachable legs were assembled make this table an example par excellence of David Roentgen&#39;s ingenious creations. His objects are an amalgamation of superior technical skills, sophisticated looks, high quality materials, and multiple functions. Roentgen&#39;s patrons sought adaptable furnishings that could perform manifold tasks. This piece is a console, a desk for writing and reading, and a game table for cards and chess with a concealed spring-driven backgammon box. Yet when closed it took up only a small amount of space in the intimate interiors popular during the Age of Enlightenment. A set of eighteenth-century game pieces - twenty-nine stamped wooden medallions illustrating European monarchs and historical views&mdash;are associated with the table.</p>\n"

His mechanical ingenuity is exemplified by the workings of the lower section of the desk: when the key of the lower drawer is turned to the right, the side drawers spring open; if a button is pressed on the underside of these drawers, each swings aside to reveal three other drawers. Although Roentgen maintained his workshop at Neuwied, Germany, where this desk was made between 1776 and 1778, his French clientele became so important that he opened an outlet in Paris and joined the Parisian guild in 1780.</p>\n"

"After extensive research and planning, conservators at The Metropolitan Museum of Art reconstructed Tullio Lombardo&#39;s &quot;Adam,&quot; documenting elements of the process with time-lapse photography.<br />\n"
"<br />\n"
"The life-size marble statue of <a href=\"http://www.metmuseum.org/collection/the-collection-online/search/197822\">Adam</a>, carved by Tullio Lombardo (Italian, ca. 1455&ndash;1532), is among the most important works of art from Renaissance Venice to be found outside that city today. Made in the early 1490s for the tomb of Doge Andrea Vendramin, it is the only signed sculpture from that monumental complex. The serene, idealized figure, inspired by ancient sculpture, is deceptively complex. Carefully manipulating composition and finish, Tullio created God&#39;s perfect human being, but also the anxious victim of the serpent&#39;s wiles.\n"
"\n"
"<p>In 2002, Adam was gravely damaged in an accident. Committed to returning it to public view, the Museum undertook a conservation treatment that has restored the sculpture to its original appearance to the fullest extent possible.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The exhibition allows Adam to be viewed in the round and explains this unprecedented twelve-year research and conservation project. It also inaugurates a new permanent gallery for Venetian and northern Italian sculpture. The installation of this gallery was made possible by Assunta Sommella Peluso, Ignazio Peluso, Ada Peluso, and Romano I. Peluso.</p>\n"
