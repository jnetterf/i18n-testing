msgid "Have you ever heard someone casually say that they are “so OCD?” If you have, it’s probably because OCD (obsessive compulsive disorder) is widely misunderstood in today’s society. Many people think if you like to clean your house a lot or have a quirky way of organizing your stuff, you have OCD – but that isn’t true. OCD is a change or disturbance in thought patterns that results in negative emotions and affects a person’s ability to behave normally. In particular, OCD is characterized by:"

Obsessions and compulsions are especially distressing as they become more complex – some people develop rituals that take up hours of their day, every day. When this happens, the symptoms are considered severe because they have the power to affect most aspects of the person’s life and often interfere with relationships, work, and school."

CBT focuses on identifying and challenging maladaptive thoughts, emotions, beliefs, and behaviors, and then replacing them with more adaptive ones. CBT also exposes patients to the situations that they’re afraid of, and helps them to change their behavior. In doing so, CBT helps patients to cope with obsessions and resist compulsions, and usually produces a 60-80% reduction in symptoms of OCD."

msgid "Scientists and mental health professionals agree that the initial onset of OCD is not preventable, but that patients may be able to manage their symptoms once they have been diagnosed. To do this, people with OCD should identify any situations or events that could trigger their symptoms and keep a diary of their symptoms so they can immediately seek treatment if their symptoms get worse. They should also continue taking all their medications as prescribed. Sometimes patients stop taking their medications when their symptoms seem to improve or go away, but that is extremely dangerous - 20% of patients stop responding to medications that once worked for them because they stopped taking them as prescribed!"

When this happens, information isn’t processed correctly and the brain starts to make mistakes when it tries to sort new data or tell the body how to respond. OCD is linked to communication problems between parts of the brain that translate information into thoughts and actions, including the orbitofrontal cortex, caudate nucleus, cingulate gyrus, and the basal ganglia. When these parts of the brain malfunction, inappropriate information is passed through the system and the person becomes overwhelmed by their thoughts and actions."

They do this by increasing the amount of a chemical messenger called serotonin in these parts of the brain, which improves information processing.

"- *Personality*: borderline, antisocial, dependent, and paranoid personality traits are associated with post traumatic stress disorder. People with these characteristics tend to be emotionally reactive and agitated in stressful situations and take longer to recover from negative experiences.\n"
"- *Perceived control*: if you have an external locus of control you believe that don’t have power over the things that happen to you, which can make it harder for you to cope with stress and increase your vulnerability after trauma.  \n"
"- *Social support*: if you don’t have a strong family or peer support system, or did not as a child, you are much more likely to develop post traumatic stress disorder.\n"
"- *Mental illness*: if you have a history of depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, or substance abuse, or if you have a close relative with depression you are more likely to develop post traumatic stress disorder after a traumatic event.\n"
"- *Life events*: stressful life events like death in the family, divorce, or losing your job can affect how you experience trauma and increase your risk of developing post traumatic stress disorder."

msgid "About 8% of US adults (including approximately 10% of all women and 4% of all men) will have post traumatic stress disorder at some point in their lives. The disorder is most common among adults who are single, divorced, or widowed, people who live in poverty, and young adults who are socially withdrawn. Women are more likely to experience post traumatic stress disorder after rape or sexual assault, whereas men are more likely to experience the disorder after combat. People who are regularly exposed to trauma (like veterans, abuse survivors, and first responders) experience post traumatic stress disorder at particularly high rates. For example, the recent wars in Afghanistan and Iraq caused post traumatic stress disorder in about 17% of returning veterans, and 30% of all veterans have the disorder. Natural disasters with lasting effects, like hurricane Katrina, the earthquakes in Japan and Haiti, and the Indian Ocean tsunami have caused PTSD in approximately 50-70% of survivors."

msgid "As you have new experiences in life, your brain has to make decisions about whether or not the situation is stressful or dangerous. If your brain perceives something as life threatening, it activates an immediate emergency response throughout your body. This response, called fight or flight, puts your body on high alert and releases hormones like adrenaline and norepinephrine. Fight or flight increases your chance of survival by shifting your body’s focus and effort to managing the stressful situation. When your safety isn't at risk any more and the threat is gone, your brain shuts down stress responses and you are able to return to normal."

After a traumatic experience takes place, it is important to quickly identify people with the highest risk of developing post traumatic stress disorder and administer targeted programs that increase coping skills and decrease distress or fear. For example, soldiers use meditation, yoga, and acupressure to work through combat-related stress, while natural disaster survivors use crisis intervention counseling to process their feelings about what happened to them.

msgid "- *Area*: It’s a lot easier to add charge to a capacitor if the parallel plates have a huge area. Two wide metal plates would give two repelling like charges a greater range to spread out across the plate, making it easier to add a lot more negative charge to one plate. Likewise, a very small plate area would cause the electrons to get cramped together earlier, making it harder to get a large difference in charge for a given voltage. From this we can guess that the capacitance of a parallel plate must be related to the plate areas."

If the plates were infinitely far apart, you would just be adding negative charges to an already negative metal surface, which would be pretty hard.

msgid "Capacitors **do not** store charge. Capacitors actually store an *imbalance of charge*. If one plate of a capacitor has 1 coulomb of charge stored on it, the other plate will have -1 coulomb, making the *total* charge (added up across both plates) zero. If you short circuit the capacitor by connecting the two plates with a wire of negligible resistance, you’ll see a sudden rush of current (depending on the size of the capacitor, this can result in sparks) as the electrons on the -1 coulomb plate rush onto the +1 coulomb plate. This sudden rush of current releases all the energy that’s stored in the capacitor."

msgid "Capacitors store energy by holding apart pairs of opposite charges. Since a positive charge and a negative charge attract each other and naturally want to come together, when they are held a fixed distance apart (for example, by a gap of insulating material such as air), their mutual attraction stores potential energy that is released if they are re-united. The simplest design for a capacitor is a parallel-plate, which consists of two metal plates with a gap between them: electrons are placed onto one plate (the negative plate), while an equal amount of electrons are removed from the other plate (the positive plate).

msgid "If you attach a capacitor (with capacitance C) to a battery (at voltage V), it will slowly develop a charge on each plate (Q) as electrons build up on one plate and then exit the other. Once you remove the battery, this difference in charge between the two plates remains indefinitely, until the capacitor is connected to a circuit (such as a light bulb) through which it can discharge. Once this occurs, charges will slowly pass out of one plate of the capacitor, move through the circuit, and onto the other plate. Capacitors function a lot like rechargeable batteries. The main difference is a capacitor’s ability to store energy doesn’t come from chemical reactions, but rather from the way that its physical design allows it to hold negative and positive charges apart. This makes capacitors very fast at charging and discharging, much faster than batteries. They are essential for applications where rapid bursts of current are needed, such as camera flashes."

msgid "Once opposite charges have been placed on either side of a parallel-plate capacitor, the charges can be used to do work by allowing them to move towards each other through a circuit. This usually requires them to travel through a circuit (as current) and perform some task, like illuminating a light bulb, along the way. The total energy that can be extracted from a fully charged capacitor is also related to the capacitance and voltage,"

msgid "Sometimes the regular rhythm of your heart pumping blood around your body stops beating regularly. It turns out that the most effective way to make the heart start ticking regularly is simply to shock it with a giant capacitor. When a patient’s heart beats too fast or doesn’t beat in the correct sequence (called fibrillation), paramedics attach two electrodes to the patient’s chest. These electrodes are connected to a defibrillator, which consists of a battery and a giant capacitor. When paramedics use defibrillators, batteries slowly charge the capacitor by adding electrons to one plate and pulling an equal number of electrons off of the other plate. Once the capacitor is charged to the set voltage, paramedics rapidly discharge the capacitor through the electrodes on the patient’s chest in hopes of resetting the heart beat. "

msgid "To help us understand *parallel plate capacitors*, consider this situation. Imagine you start with two metal plates with no difference of charge (Q= 0). You attach a battery, which at first adds a single electron to one side of the capacitor. The electron has an electric field that repels other electrons, and this field reaches through space and pushes on the electrons in the other plate, causing that plate to acquire an **induced positive charge**. Now your first plate has a charge of -1e, and the far plate has a charge of +1e, where e is the way we normally write the elementary charge of a single electron."

msgid "Another way to think about this is to remember that Q = CV, where Q is the charge of the capacitor, V is the voltage difference across the two plates, and C is the capacitance. For this setup, Q is fixed because the capacitor is not connected to any power source that can change the relative amount of charge on the two plates. Since adding the dielectric increases C by a factor of 3, the voltage must decrease by a factor of three in order to keep Q the same. You can now plug the new values of Q, C, V into the equation for the energy stored in a capacitor, E = 1/2 C V$^2$, and determine that the energy stored in the capacitor also decreases by a factor of 3."

msgid "For example, imagine that you’ve charged up your favorite parallel plate capacitor to a voltage of 6V across the plates. This 6V difference corresponds to an electric field between the plates, which is the voltage divided by the distance between the plates, d. If you have a huge capacitor with a plate separation of 1 cm, that’s an electric field of 6 V/cm. But imagine that you stick a big chunk of beeswax (k = 3) into your capacitor after it’s been fully charged and disconnected from the battery. All of the sudden, the charges on the molecules in the beeswax will shift and orient themselves in such a way that they partly cancel out the original field. Because the total amount of polarization is related to the dielectric constant, your capacitor now has an internal field of only 6/3 = 2 V/cm. Since the plate separation is the same, this corresponds to a new capacitor voltage of only 2V! "

msgid "In the drawing, the “leash” that ties the electrons to atoms has been drawn to look like a spring. Just like a spring, the force that causes electrons to orbit the nucleus provides a *restoring force* that counteracts the force exerted by the external electric field from the battery. So as the battery’s electric field pushes the electrons further and further towards one side of the atom, the restoring force in the opposite direction that pulls them back towards the nucleus gradually increases. The final position of the electrons corresponds to when these two forces (the one from the nucleus and the one from the battery) balance each other out."

msgid "That said, if a large enough electric field is applied to a dielectric, the forces that want to push the electrons can actually overcome the force that tethers them to the atomic nucleus, resulting in the electrons being ripped off their leashes. Large electric fields *ionize* the atoms of a dielectric. This means large electric fields create free charges (electrons in this case) that are able to move freely through the material and carry current. This process is called *dielectric* *breakdown* because the dielectric transitions from being an insulator to a conductor. In most real-world capacitors, dielectric breakdown results in a spark and damage to the capacitor."

This time the voltage, V, is fixed at 6V in the equation Q = CV, and so when you add the dielectric and cause the capacitance to jump by a factor of 3, the difference in charge across the two plates, Q, also increases by a factor of 3. In this situation, using the formula E = 1/2 C V$^2$ reveals that the energy stored in the capacitor actually increases by a factor of three."

msgid "When a battery is connected to a conductor, the potential difference of the two poles of the  battery pushes on all the charges in the conductor, which in turn causes them to drift slowly through the material—creating a *current* through the conductor. This happens because the outer electrons in a conductor are not attached to particular nuclei; they can wander freely throughout the entire material. In a dielectric, the charges are valence electrons that are stuck inside atoms of a crystal or polymer, and so current doesn’t flow at all. The electric field, however, *still* exerts a *force* on the charges. While the individual electrons remain tied to their parent atoms, they prefer to stay on the side of the atom that’s closer to the positive terminal. You can imagine the electrons wanting to jump off their parent atoms, but instead remaining leashed to them by the electrostatic forces that bind valence electrons to the nucleus:"

msgid "When you’re dealing with the kinds of voltages found in lightning strikes, the soggy ground beneath you is pretty conductive, and your body is, too. But your hair is not conductive. Human hair is such a good insulator that it actually used to be used as shielding in some old-school electrostatic machines. Thus if lightning is about to strike you, your hair acts like the dielectric in a capacitor, where the two conducting plates are the clouds (which have a huge negative charge) and the soggy ground below (which builds up a large positive charge due to induction). Thus, as charge builds up in the cloud, an electric field builds up in *your hair*. But unlike the glass or plastic inside a parallel-plate capacitor, the strands of your hair can easily move around individually, and so the electric field causes them to rise up, towards the clouds. Just like the individual electrons in a polarizable dielectric, the charges in them want to complete the circuit and travel up to the clouds, but they can’t quite make it because they are tethered to your head!"

Because the light is not being bent toward a single point, the focal point is not as obvious as it was in the case of the converging lens.

msgid "Traffic mirrors to help see around corners at intersections use convex mirrors so that the image will always be virtual and upright, but smaller than the actual scene, so that you can see more of the road than you otherwise would be able to. But a side effect of this expanded field of view is that the virtual distances are compressed, hence the origin of the ubiquitous phrase “objects in the mirror are closer than they appear.”"

msgid "You might have heard people talk about Einstein’s speed of light, and that it’s always the same. The part that most people leave out is that this is only true in a vacuum--when there’s no pesky molecules of air or water to slow it down. But when light moves through a more familiar medium like air, it moves moves more slowly due to the interactions of individual photons with the molecules in the material. In general, the more optically dense the medium, the slower the light will move.  So what happens to the light when it goes from one medium to another?"

msgid "A related type of beta decay actually decreases the atomic number of the nucleus when a proton becomes a neutron. Due to charge conservation, this type of beta decay involves the release of a charged particle called a “positron” that looks and acts like an electron but has a positive charge. Because this particle’s interactions with other tissues are easily identifiable, some medical imaging techniques involve purposefully injecting a patient with an element that beta decays into positrons, and then monitoring where the positrons are emitted. When beta decay creates a positron it’s called *beta-plus* decay, and when it releases a neutron it’s called *beta-minus* decay."

The former case is more familiar from chemistry class, since a lot of the common light elements used in biology (like oxygen, carbon, and nitrogen) have the same number of protons as neutrons. But it turns out that the case of carbon having 6 protons and 8 neutrons, while not as stable as 6 and 6, is stable enough that it can actually occur in nature in observable amounts. Because the 8 neutron nucleus and the 6 neutron nucleus are technically both carbon, we call them different *isotopes* of carbon."

If you have a single nucleus that you are certain will eventually decay into a different nucleus, you still have only a rough idea how long it will take for you to see it happen. You could be sitting watching the nucleus for anywhere between a few seconds to your entire lifetime, and at some point it would suddenly decay without any warning! However, depending on the type of nucleus, you can predict how long on average it would take to decay if you watched many nuclei at once. So while the average time to decay is a measurable number (for potassium it’s over a billion years), the exact time of the decay is entirely random."

msgid "The radium nucleus (Ra, atomic number 88) breaks up into the helium nucleus (He$^{2+}$, the little chunk) and a *daughter nucleus* that corresponds to the element radon (Rn, atomic number 86). The medical risks associated with radiation usually involve the fast speeds at which the products of nuclear reactions move.Think of the alpha particle released by this reaction as a tiny bullet, which can puncture soft tissues like the lining of the stomach and lungs. Fortunately, alpha decay tends to release large, slow-moving decay products, and so it’s easy to shield against this type of radiation."

msgid "The reaction shown above illustrates another, indirect method by which alpha decay can pose a hazard. Radium, the element on the left hand side of the reaction arrow, can be found deep underground as a solid rock mixed in with granite. However, when it undergoes alpha decay it turns into radon, which naturally prefers to be a gas. The radon then seeps out of the ground and into the basements of people’s homes, where it can enter their lungs and then decay again, releasing more alpha particles (or other types of radiation) directly into the unprotected tissues. This method of radon exposure represents a major lung cancer risk factor in many parts of the world."

These released particles are a side effect of the element changing its atomic number or mass, and they are what scientists generally mean when they warn about nuclear radiation, since fast-moving particles can act like tiny bullets that poke holes in your body. However, much nuclear radiation is actually harmless, and it occasionally can be harnessed to provide new type of medical or diagnostic tools."

Each estimate is very specific to one group of individuals and their environment, which means that it could not be generalized. However, we can look at large groups of people and develop a range of estimates to tell us more about a particular trait of interest. The range allows for interpersonal and small group differences that are influenced by specific environments, but still gives us important information about the differences in people’s traits. "

msgid "Scientists can look at the influence of genes on behavior by using a mathematical formula called a heritability estimate. Heritability estimates give information about how much of an impact genes have on a behavior in a certain environment. Think about blood type as an example - in your group of friends, there is probably some variation in your blood types. If differences in blood type are mostly influenced by genes then the heritability estimate would reflect that. Heritability estimates can range from 0 to 1; when the estimate is higher (closer to 1), this means that genes have a larger influence on the behavior of interest, as it would be with blood type. When the estimate is lower (closer to 0), it reflects a larger impact of the environment on the behavior. To study heritability, scientists use information from identical twins that were separated at birth, like Karen and Jennifer. They do this because the genetic material of identical twins is almost exactly the same, which makes it easier to determine the relative influence of the environment.  "

By eating nutritious foods and staying physically active, the genes increasing her chance of developing obesity are not expressed and she never develops obesity."

msgid "The characteristics (physical traits and behaviors) that you are born with and what you experience throughout your life are both important. Your characteristics can impact your experiences and your experiences can impact your characteristics.  Karen and Jennifer’s life experiences influenced when and how their genes were expressed. The relationship between your genes and behavior can change over time as you have new experiences. In some situations, genes play a larger role in determining your behavior; in other situations, environment plays a larger role in influencing your behavior. If you had   a whole different set of experiences over your lifetime your genes may be expressed in different ways, and you may behave differently than you do now. If Jennifer and Karen had grown up in the same environment, their health behaviors would probably be more similar to one another."

In Karen’s town where healthy food is scarce - many of her neighbors do not get enough to eat and are malnourished. The athletic ability of Karen and her neighbors is decreased and the heritability of athleticism is closer to 0, because their experiences in a financially poor environment have inhibited genes associated with athleticism. On the other hand, Jennifer and her neighbors eat plenty of healthy foods are well nourished. If we look at the athletic ability of Jennifer’s neighbors, the heritability estimate is closer to 1 because their experiences in financially well off environment have enabled their athleticism genes to be expressed."

msgid ">Scientists can look at the influence of genes on behavior by using a mathematical formula called a heritability estimate. Heritability estimates give information about how much of an impact genes have on a behavior in a certain environment. Think about blood type as an example - in your group of friends, there is probably some variation in your blood types. If differences in blood type are mostly influenced by genes then the heritability estimate would reflect that. Heritability estimates can range from 0 to 1; when the estimate is higher (closer to 1), this means that genes have a larger influence on the behavior of interest, as it would be with blood type. When the estimate is lower (closer to 0), it reflects a larger impact of the environment on the behavior. To study heritability, scientists use information from identical twins that were separated at birth, like Karen and Jennifer. They do this because the genetic material of identical twins is almost exactly the same, which makes it easier to determine the relative influence of the environment.  "

msgid "Also interesting to think about is just why it is you dance when you see that sandwich in the first place. Earlier, we stated that it is was the unconditioned stimulus because it took no learning to cause you to dance at the sight of it. At the start of our thought experiment, that was true. However, when you were first introduced to PB&J, you would dance while eating it because it tasted so good. Eventually,  an association between sight and taste formed (learned via classical conditioning) and you began to dance preemptively - just the sight was enough to trigger the feelings of joy expressed by the dance.. If we really follow this line of thought about our everyday actions, we’ll find that many, if not most, of our actions can be traced back to pretty basic needs like food, shelter, comfort, etc. "

Your parents try to make it better by serving it on your favorite tiger plate, but you soon realize the tiger plate does not mean PB&J. You lose the association between the tiger plate and PB&J, and stop doing your happy dance whenever you see that plate. We call this *extinction* – your conditioned response (happy dance) disappeared. However, when peanut butter in your house again and your parents serve you PB&J on your tiger plate, the previous association between the tiger plate and PB&J dance quickly will come back in full force.

msgid "In classical conditioning, the stimuli that *precede* a behavior will vary (PB&J sandwich, then tiger plate), to alter that behavior(e.g. dancing with the tiger plate!). In operant conditioning, the consequences which come *after* a behavior will vary, to alter that behavior. Imagine years down the road you are still enamored of delicious PB&J sandwiches, and now are trying to teach yourself to be a good roommate. The house rule is that whoever leaves their dishes unwashed the longest has to take out the trash. You hate taking out the trash, so you develop a system - whenever you remember to wash your plate, you are allowed to surf the internet, otherwise you’re not allowed. The more dishes you wash, the more you get to procrastinate on your favorite sites. Initially, you leave the plate in the sink a few times, then you begin to remember after a day or so, and finally you start to wash your dishes immediately after using them. This process of *shaping* involves intermediate behaviors (leaving the plate in the sink and beginning to come back to wash the dishes within hours) that start moving you towards the goal behavior (washing your dishes immediately).

"- *Extrinsic motivation* is motivation that is based on external factors like money, rewards, obligations, or approval. For example, my brother sells a specific number of snowboards each year because he needs to make money and wants to earn rewards from his job.  "

msgid "- *Learned needs* are needs that come from your experiences and are heavily influenced by things that happen to you throughout your life. You learn to want things like praise, money, success, and pleasure - you aren’t born with the goal of becoming a CEO or opening a business, that is something that you learn to want. One learned needs theory, incentive theory, suggests that any experience that is connected to a reward will make you more motivated to act. For example, some libraries offer a pizza party to children who read a dozen books over the summer. If a child wants the prize, she will work hard and be motivated to read the books. As an adult, a financial bonus or reward from your job is a common learned need. For example, my brother is a sales representative for a snowboard company. If he sells the most boards during the year, he earns a free snowboarding trip to Canada. Because he really loves to snowboard and wants the bonus, he learned to work harder and longer during the snowboarding season and he usually wins it! Learned needs can also be the result of social relationships and culture. For example, if my brother married a woman who felt wealth and status were really important, he might shift his goals - instead of being motivated to win a snowboarding trip, he would be motivated to work hard and earn extra money so that she could have the lifestyle she wants.

msgid "- *Physiological needs* are innate, biological, and must be met in order for you to survive. Some basic examples of physiological needs are things like hunger, thirst, and pain avoidance, which are all regulated by your body’s internal systems and are feelings that you have from the day that you’re born. Motivation theories that focus on physiological needs emphasize the importance of homeostasis, or processes that your body uses to keep your internal systems balanced and stable (like temperature regulation), and your body’s natural tendencies throughout the day (like your circadian rhythm). One motivation theory based on physiological needs is drive reduction theory, which suggests that motivation comes from your desire to reduce internal tension, which is a signal from your body that something is off and you need to act to survive. For example, you feel hungry because your body releases hormones at specific times throughout the day. You eat a burger to reduce that hunger, which restores balance in your body. In the same way, when you have a headache, you take medicine to reduce the pain you feel - your body is telling you that something is wrong, and you have to act in a way that fixes the problem. "

msgid "- *Psychological needs* are based on your thoughts, feelings, beliefs, expectations, and self-image. Psychological needs are important for your mental health and happiness, and to balance and harmony in your mind. One theory that focuses on psychological needs is cognitive dissonance theory, which suggests that when there are significant differences between what you think or believe and how you act, you feel uncomfortable or unhappy. Your discomfort makes you want to change your behavior so that you’ll feel better. For example, if you believe that dishonesty is awful and makes you a bad person, lying would probably make you feel really uncomfortable, anxious, and upset. You would keep feeling uncomfortable until you acted differently, in a way that is more consistent with your beliefs and thoughts - which would mean telling the truth. Once you tell the truth, you will feel relieved and your anxiety will be gone. "

"- When you set and achieve goals, you feel happy and are more motivated to continue to set high standards for yourself. Why? The answer is in your brain - when you achieve goals your brain releases dopamine, which is a chemical that is linked to feelings of pleasure. \n"
"- Some people believe that the key to achieving a goal is writing it down! When you write down a goal, make sure that it’s specific, outline small discrete steps that will help you achieve your goal, and give yourself an amount of time to complete the goal. For example, instead of “I will lose weight” write down “I will lose 10 pounds in 6 months by running 2 miles three times per week, and taking a yoga class four times per week.”\n"
"- Friendships can have a huge impact on your motivation! When your friends are highly motivated to set career or health goals, you are more likely to do the same and be a high achiever yourself. "

msgid "Both intrinsic and extrinsic motivation are important, and most people take both into account when they set goals for themselves. Think about how the two would come into play in my brother’s working environment. Intrinsically motivated behavior improves his work quality - he loves snowboarding and genuinely wants other people to love it too, which is why he wants to be a part of the winter sports industry. Extrinsically motivated behavior improves his work quantity, because as he sells more snowboards, he is rewarded - he gets praise from his bosses, earns more money, and is eligible for rewards. Because he is intrinsically and extrinsically motivated to work in the snowboarding industry he is able to be one of the best representatives in the business - people love his energy and enthusiasm, so he ends up selling tons of snowboards each year and earning a great salary! His situation is pretty typical - most managers will ask you about your career goals and your interests, because if they can find a way to combine what you love to do with your assigned tasks, you’ll be a better, happier (and more motivated!) worker.

msgid "His theory placed needs into three separate categories - basic needs, psychological needs, and self-fulfillment needs. The basic needs like food, water, air, and a safe place to live have to be met before you can try to reach other goals, like having friends or positive self-esteem. As you fulfill needs from the bottom of the pyramid, you are able to pursue goals that lead to your happiness and personal growth. For example, if you are homeless, do not have enough to eat, and do not live in a safe environment, you probably won’t be as interested in expressing yourself creatively or finding prestige at work. If you are safe and secure in a loving environment, you are more likely to want to strive for achievement at work or in your community. Maslow believed that you are motivated to become your best self and will work to achieve self-actualization, which means you are your best, most creative and happy self! "

The tertiary structure is formed by the coming together of several secondary structures that are held together by various types of interactions, and finally a quaternary structure is formed by the combination of several tertiary structures, again held together via different types of interactions.

The first, the *antiparallel β sheet*, has neighboring hydrogen-bonded polypeptide chains running in opposite directions—i.e., one polypeptide chain starts from the terminal carboxylic group and ends at the terminal amino group, left to right, while the other polypeptide chain starts from the terminal amino group and ends at the terminal carboxylic group, left to right.

If proteins stop working correctly because of changes to shape, and they undergo these changes because of alterations to their amino acid sequence, then the obvious thing to do is fix the problem at its source, by changing the instructions that specify the amino acid sequence of the protein: the gene.

msgid "Somewhat surprisingly, the obvious problem with this approach—how can you tell a cell how to start using the right amino acids to build a protein?—has largely been solved, at least in theory. Gene editing techniques such as CRISPR-cas9 allow scientists to cut and paste DNA sequences into the genome of living organisms. Although this technology is still in its infancy, it should eventually allow doctors to identify and replace mutated portions of a gene coding for a misshapen protein. The remaining roadblocks largely have to do with unintended consequences of such techniques. Editing the DNA of a certain gene has so far proven to introduce accidental changes in other parts of the genome, which often times results in permanently altering the production of other proteins. And these unintended alterations in protein production can lead to cancer. In other words, we don’t yet know, in general, how to cure one disease without potentially causing another. Recent developments have shown promise in controlling the unintended consequences of gene therapy, and potential cures for genetic diseases and certain types of cancer via gene therapeutic routes are in clinical trials now."

Once the molecular mechanics of a cell link the specific amino acids together into a linear chain, with each amino acid joined to its two neighbors by peptide bonds, the protein folds up into a complex three-dimensional shape, called the native conformation. The native conformation is analogous to a plane with all its parts in the right place: when a protein is in its native conformation, it’s ready to work. When something happens to knock it out of its native conformation, its effectiveness decreases or gets lost all together."

Since gluconeogenesis is glycolysis in reverse, you can imagine that some roadblocks occur at the irreversible steps of the glycolysis pathway. The irreversible steps of the glycolysis pathway release *a lot* of energy when they occur. In contrast, performing these irreversible steps in the opposite direction during gluconeogenesis requires a lot of energy, as the energy needed is equal to the energy that was released in the forward reaction. Since the goal of gluconeogenesis is to produce emergency sources of energy when you haven’t eaten food, there usually isn’t enough energy available. Instead, the cell has come up with a roundabout way to still run gluconeogenesis (or to still run the reverse of glycolysis) without requiring large amounts of energy. Only the irreversible reactions require these roundabout ways, or detours, as the rest of the reactions are reversible and do not require *large amounts* of energy, regardless of the direction of the reaction."

Yet, your body still needs to have energy to live and get you out of bed. One of the ways your body can produce the energy (glucose) you need is by reversing the process of glycolysis. This   reversal of glycolysis is called **gluconeogenesis**. Instead of using carbohydrates to produce glucose, our body converts non-carbohydrate sources (like amino acids) in our liver into glucose.

msgid "Sometimes there can be mistakes in important pathways, like the ones we just discussed. If a mistake occurs in gluconeogenesis, it can lead to low blood glucose levels a condition called hypoglycemia. Low glucose levels means there isn’t enough energy to fuel the organs and can lead to temporary brain malfunction, seizures, permanent brain damage or even death. "

As we mentioned before, detours are required in gluconeogenesis to get around the irreversible reactions of the glycolysis pathway. The reactions in step 1, converting pyruvate into oxaloacetatete, and oxaloacetate into phosphoenolpyruvate, are the first detour. "

Aside from helping build molecules, what kind of benefit is this really for the cell? NADPH is able to donate its electrons to compounds that fight dangerous oxygen molecules. These compounds are called antioxidants and you’ve probably heard about them being in some foods. Antioxidants donate electrons to neutralize dangerous oxygen radicals (super reactive oxygen molecules). Once they have given away their electrons, antioxidants need to quickly reload in case there are more oxygen radicals.

msgid "The A nucleotides are always hydrogen bonded to T nucleotides, and C nucleotides are always hydrogen bonded to G nucleotides. This selective binding is called *complementary base pairing*, and creates consistency in the nucleotide sequences of the two DNA polymers that join together to make a chromosome. This was first observed by Erwin Chargaff, who developed methods for counting nucleotides in DNA samples, and found that the percent of A nucleotides always equaled the percent of T nucleotides, and the percent of G nucleotides always equaled the percent of C nucleotides (within a margin of error). Now, we know that complementary base pairing can be explained by reference to hydrogen bonding between the donors and acceptors on the bases of each nucleotide: A nucleotides and T nucleotides have a match (one donor and one acceptor each), and C nucleotides and G nucleotides have a match (the former has one donor and two acceptors, while the latter has one acceptor and two donors).

Traits—everything from eye color, on the simple side, to complex things like autism or the ability to run extremely fast—arise from complicated interactions between proteins, the cells that make them, and the surrounding environment. These interactions vary across time and space, and are further modulated by non-biological factors like diet (relatively simple to understand) to socio-economic status and parenting (extremely hard to quantify and map on to biological processes). It’s almost always a gross simplification to refer to any one gene as being “for” a particular human trait. "

msgid "If you take a second to think about all the advantages a regular rabbit has against an imaginary rabbit with no enzymes, you will begin to understand how these miraculous devices came about in the first place. Somewhere in the depths of history, a tiny single cell organism, through the actions of random chance, developed a prehistoric enzyme, which allowed some chemical reaction that happened inside the organism to happen just a little faster than the same reaction in its neighboring organisms. This slight advantage made our tiny organism just a touch better at reproducing, and the rest, as they say, is history. The ancestors of the original pioneering organism retained this advantage and quickly multiplied. Other chance occurrences created other new enzymes, and new and better adapted forms of life, eventually culminating, over millions and millions of years, in our rabbit, reacting to the owl in the sky in and bounding to safety, just in the knick of time.

msgid "In order to maintain the conditions needed for these reactions to occur, the rabbitt’s cells need to “burn energy.” The rabbit eats grass. The grass gets converted to simple sugars. The simple sugars get converted to fuel molecules. Cells “burn” these molecules, like a car “burns” gasoline. Burning fuel molecules releases energy, and this energy increases the speed with which molecules travel inside cells. A cell burning energy has the same effect on the molecules inside it as shaking our imaginary jar has on the red and blue magnets inside it. In both cases, work is being done that results in more collisions happening, which in turn results in more reactions happening. "

msgid "One way to visualize a molecule like nitric oxide is as two magnets stuck together. If you’ve ever played around with magnets, you know that in order for two to stick together, you need to align the “pole” of one --- all magnets have a north and a south pole --- with the opposite pole of the other: north to south, or south to north. You also know that if you try and align one pole of a magnet with the same pole of the other, the magnets will repel. Nitrogen and oxygen atoms are like magnets in this sense. If you align them in just the right way, so that the “north pole” of the nitrogen is right up next to the “south pole” of oxygen, they will stick together to form the molecule we call nitric oxide. Chemical “bonds” are really nothing more than attractions between atoms! "

The first rule is that there is a mutual attraction between red magnets and blue magnets. This means that if you stick the north pole of a red magnet to the south pole of a blue magnet, they will stick together, just like you would expect with two magnets. The second rule is that there is a *stronger* mutual attraction between magnets of the same color: red to red, or blue to blue.

On the one hand, you have the requirement for everything to happen inside the rabbits body very rapidly--this is how it evades predators, beats other rabbits to food sources, and reproduces. On the other hand, you have the limitation imposed on the rabbit by the environment and its own body. There aren’t unlimited amounts of food available for it to eat. It often has to travel long distances to access this food. It has to process the food into usable fuel for its cells. It has to efficiently dispose of the heat generated when it burns the fuel. In short: the rabbit needs the speedy reactions associated with burning lots of energy, but it can’t burn too much because energy isn’t free: in fact, it’s very hard to come by, and there are costs associated with using it.

"Around 30,000 to 40,000 years ago, humans began domesticating wolves. Nowadays, these domesticated animals are what we call dogs! Domestication is the act of separating a small group of organisms (wolves, in this case) from the main population, and select for their desired traits through breeding. Over thousands of years, the domestication of wolves resulted in the loss of some of the more aggressive traits, like the instinctual, defensive behavior in the presence of humans (barking or howling, bearing their teeth, poising to attack, or running away), and the size and shape of their teeth. The exact reasoning why humans began domesticating wolves isn’t known although evolutionary biologists suspect that wolves helped humans to hunt during the ice age (Callaway, 2015). In fact, they’ve also hypothesized that if this is true, their domestication could have been what helped human ancestors through the ice age and why Neanderthals went extinct (Callaway, 2015)! Now humans select for a variety of traits in dogs based on personal preference and companionship, instead of as a way to increase human survival. \n"

msgid "Can beneficial traits arise in more than one area by accident? Yes! Let’s go back to our lactose tolerance example at the beginning of the article. When multiple environments favor the existence of a trait, these beneficial traits can pop up through mutation and spread throughout their individual populations completely independently. Evolutionary biologists call this *convergent evolution*. In the lactose tolerance example, this is exactly what happened. A population in Europe evolved the ability to digest lactose as an adult independently from an African population. Both populations had begun farming dairy, and both traits arose around the same time. What’s cool is that, when the lactose tolerance trait arose, these populations were far enough away that they were not able to reproduce with each other making the development of the trait a neat coincidence."

msgid "Evolution is how species experience heritable (passed from one generation to the next) changes in their traits over time. In order for evolutionary changes to occur, many generations over thousands to millions of years are often required - meaning, these adaptations don’t happen overnight! The ability of humans to digest lactose as adults is a perfect example of this. As babies, a majority of humans have the ability to digest lactose. As we develop into adults, some people lose the ability to digest lactose, and others continue to have no problem digesting milks, cheeses, and other food products containing lactose. A hereditary mutation responsible for the trait allowing humans to digest lactose well into adulthood is kept “on”, resulting in lactose tolerance. This trait is a result of a mutation from thousands of years ago. The mutation causing the trait was beneficial and heritable, so it spread throughout the human population and many of us today have this trait!"

Terms like “progress” or “improvement” are not a part of the definition of evolution because evolution is *context dependent*. Imagine a scenario where one trait might be highly advantageous in one environment, but highly detrimental in another. A good example of this is the fur color of mice. It’s advantageous if mice blend in with their habitat so that they can avoid predators. In the forest, it will be more likely that mice take on a darker color to match the earth. If you were to take a mouse with dark fur out of their original habitat and place it on a white sandy beach, it will get snatched up by a bird very quickly because it’s so easy to see."

Recently we have started to artificially select traits at a molecular level where we mix DNA from different plant or animal species to make genetically modified organisms (GMOs). To genetically modify an organism, genetic information (or, the blueprint of the organism) is added or removed, or replaced by the information from another organism that has a trait we desire. For example, let’s say you have a species of corn that is highly susceptible to drought, but is the most delicious corn that exists. If you could identify the genetic information that coded for drought resistance from another plant, then you could insert that into the blueprints of your corn species to make it more resistant to drought!

msgid "When you have an infection, the multiplying pathogenic bacteria inside of you are not all identical. Most of them are the same, but every now and again one of of them will be slightly different genetically. If they were all genetically identical, they would react to their environment the same way and all be harmed by the same things. One harmful thing could wipe out the entire species. But when there are slight genetic differences, harmful conditions, like the presence of an antibiotic, might kill most of the pathogenic bacteria but some may be better able to survive and then thrive. These characteristics are favored in this environment so these bacteria can continue to thrive, and make you ill. Different environments favor different traits and so natural selection has taken place!"

msgid "In oxidative phosphorylation, oxygen *must* be present to receive electrons from the protein complexes. This allows for more electrons and high energy molecules to be passed along, and maintains the hydrogen pumping that produces ATP. What happens if we run out of oxygen? How to we break down our food to make energy? The body has a plan B for this situation called fermentation. It happens all the time in athletes, like runners, when they use all their oxygen and produce lactic acid. Fermentation starts after glycolysis, replacing the citric acid cycle and oxidative phosphorylation. During glycolysis, only two ATP molecules are produced. NADH is then oxidized to transform the pyruvates made in glycolysis into lactic acid. "

"**Step 3: The citric acid cycle**  \n"
"The citric acid cycle is called a cycle because the starting molecule, oxaloacetate (which has 4 carbons), is regenerated at the end of the cycle. Throughout the citric acid cycle, oxaloacetate is progressively transformed into several different molecules (as carbon atoms are added to and removed from it), but at the end of the cycle it always turns back into oxaloacetate to be used again. Energy can be captured from this cycle because several of the steps are energetically favourable. When a step is favoured, it means that the products of the reaction have lower energy than the reactants. The difference in energy between the products and the reactants is the energy that is released when the reaction takes place (see enzyme kinetics). The released energy is captured as the electron shuttles (NAD$^\\text{+}$ and FAD) are reduced to NADH and FADH$_{2}$ ."

When this electron shuttle is not carrying high energy electrons, meaning it has been oxidized (lost its electrons), it is left with a positive charge and is called NAD$^\\text{+}$.\n"

msgid "The human body is amazingly complex and yet, it functions because of a molecule that supports many of our essential life processes - called ATP (adenosine triphosphate). ATP is the energy currency of the cell and provides energy for processes that build molecules and tissues, to transport molecules across the cell membrane, to facilitate enzyme activities, to facilitate motion, and is the product of a few steps in metabolism (which you’ll see below).

msgid "The phosphate group that made a bond with the hydroxyl group (now called a phosphoryl group) breaks off from the ATP molecule. The electrons that formed the bond that attached that phosphate group to ATP move onto the neighboring oxygen. These actions cause the oxygen molecule to become negatively charged, produce ADP, (a phosphoryl group) and produce energy. The bonds of the phosphate group contained high energy electrons (also seen in the different steps of cellular respiration). When the phosphate is broken off, the electrons come down to a lower energy state. The difference in energy states is the energy that is released by the reaction."

msgid "What happens when there is too much ATP hydrolysis? Lactic acidosis happens! Lactic acidosis is a health condition that occurs when our blood and tissues become acidic because of a build of hydronium ions from ATP hydrolysis. The buildup of hydronium ions increases the acidity of the tissues and blood (hydronium ions are interchangeable with hydrogen ions when talking about acidity). This happens when our cells aren’t receiving enough oxygen, like when you’re doing anaerobic exercise (sprinting). Recall from cellular respiration that when oxygen is absent, fermentation replaces the citric acid cycle and oxidative phosphorylation, but glycolysis continues to occur so that some ATP are still being made. On top of increasing hydronium ions being made, there is also a buildup of lactate from fermentation, which is where lactic acidosis gets its name. "

msgid "When ATP hydrolysis occurs at the same time as another reaction, the reactions are called **coupled reactions**. Often, during anabolic reactions (like when you’re trying to build extra muscle for that triathlon), ATP will donate its phosphate group to the reactant to build a polymer (a molecule that is a long chain of repeating units). This coupling of reactions with ATP hydrolysis is what physically helps to build longer molecules, while also providing energy for the reaction to take place. That’s pretty handy!"

With desmosomes, cell membranes are connected by thread like substances that connect the cells across the space in between cells. Much like tight junctions, desmosomes physically hold the cells together, but do not allow fluids or materials to pass from the inside of one cell to the next. These connections are also attached to the scaffolding of the cell, called the cytoskeleton, to help with structural support. The space in between the cells allows for water and solutes to flow freely between each cell without compromising the connection. This is convenient for areas of our body that experience high stress like in our skin or our intestines because the space in between the cells offer flexibility that the other junctions can’t."

This is different than phagocytosis, which brings full, undissolved or insoluble molecules into the cell. The distortion of the cell membrane to engulf the dissolved solutes is similar to that of phagocytosis. Another important distinction is that pinocytosis is not specific to what is carried into the cell, whereas phagocytosis can be highly specific. The liquid medium outside the cell is always filled with dissolved particles and solutes that are handy for the cell, so the cell doesn’t need this process to be specific. "

The process starts by the molecule binding to specific receptors on the surface of the cell membrane, triggering the cell membrane to reshape, surrounding the molecule. The receptors allow this process to be specific, controlling what can enter the cell. Then, the the two ends of the cell fuse, creating a vesicle that surrounds the molecule. Eventually the membrane around the molecule will be digested and its contents will be used! For example, white blood cells recognize pathogens, such as viruses or bacterial cells, outside of the cell and will use phagocytosis to bring it in to destroy it! "

msgid "> Finally, desmosomes are quite different from gap junctions and tight junctions. With desmosomes, cell membranes are connected by thread like substances that connect the cells across the space in between cells. Much like tight junctions, desmosomes physically hold the cells together, but do not allow fluids or materials to pass from the inside of one cell to the next. These connections are also attached to the scaffolding of the cell, called the cytoskeleton, to help with structural support. The space in between the cells allows for water and solutes to flow freely between each cell without compromising the connection. This is convenient for areas of our body that experience high stress like in our skin or our intestines because the space in between the cells offer flexibility that the other junctions can’t."

msgid ">If phagocytosis is how the cell eats, then pinocytosis is how the cell drinks. Pinocytosis engulfs dissolved ions and other solutes in the liquid medium surrounding the cell. This is different than phagocytosis, which brings full, undissolved or insoluble molecules into the cell. The distortion of the cell membrane to engulf the dissolved solutes is similar to that of phagocytosis. Another important distinction is that pinocytosis is not specific to what is carried into the cell, whereas phagocytosis can be highly specific. The liquid medium outside the cell is always filled with dissolved particles and solutes that are handy for the cell, so the cell doesn’t need this process to be specific. "

msgid ">Phagocytosis is the process similar to eating, where the cell engulfs a molecule in order to move it to the interior of the cell. The process starts by the molecule binding to specific receptors on the surface of the cell membrane, triggering the cell membrane to reshape, surrounding the molecule. The receptors allow this process to be specific, controlling what can enter the cell. Then, the the two ends of the cell fuse, creating a vesicle that surrounds the molecule. Eventually the membrane around the molecule will be digested and its contents will be used! For example, white blood cells recognize pathogens, such as viruses or bacterial cells, outside of the cell and will use phagocytosis to bring it in to destroy it! "

Additionally, errors in specific gap junction genes called, Cx43 and Cx56.6, can lead to the breakdown of some of our brain tissue called white matter which makes up 60% of our brain.

The two tails are made up of fatty acids (chains of carbon atoms) that aren’t compatible with, or repel, water (*hydrophobic*). The cell membrane is exposed to water mixed with electrolytes and other materials on the outside and the inside of the cell. When cellular membranes form, phospholipids assemble into two layers because of these hydrophilic and hydrophobic properties. The phosphate heads in each layer face the aqueous or watery environment on either side, and the tails hide away from the water between the layers of heads, because they are hydrophobic. Biologists call this neat assembling characteristic “self-assembly”."

There are many diseases associated with problems in the ability of the phospholipid bilayer to perform these functions. One of these is Alzheimer’s disease, characterized by brain shrinkage and memory loss. One idea explaining why Alzheimer’s disease occurs is the forming of plaque sticking to the phospholipid bilayer of the brain neurons. These plaques block communication between the brain neurons, eventually leading to neuron death and in turn causing the symptoms of Alzheimer’s, such as poor short-term memory."

"Aneuploidy is a catchall term that refers to mistakes in the number of chromosomes in an organism (the prefix “eu-” essentially means “normal”, and adding “an-” in front --- “an-eu-” --- means “not normal”). For example, a human somatic cell with 46 chromosomes, or a nematode somatic cell with 4, or a human gamete with 23, is “eu-ploid” --- it has the right number of chromosomes.

The metaphase of meiosis I is different, though: Instead of lining up in single file, the bivalent chromosomes line up two-by-two.

msgid "This mistake has profound consequences. The physical and mental development of people with Down syndrome is curbed, and results in a spectrum of handicaps ranging in severity from mild to severe. But why? Clearly, having an extra set of the genes contained in chromosome 21 does something to development, but pinpointing the effects is very difficult. The puzzle of trisomy 21 is all the more vexing when you compare its effects with those of other, more benign aneuploidies. Women with so-called “triple X syndrome,” which occurs when a female’s somatic cells have three X chromosomes instead of two (for a total of 47 chromosomes), are, in most cases, visually and clinically indistinguishable from women without the “syndrome.” Similarly, men with “XYY syndrome” have an extra Y chromosome, but no distinguishable symptoms.

Studies have shown that copper ions reduce sperm’s motility, ability to trigger the acrosomal reaction, and general viability. Though the devices release less copper than what could be found in our diets, the copper build-up in the mucous lining of the cervix and uterine is enough to halt the movement of sperm. IUDs in general also trigger a mild inflammatory reaction that brings in immune cells that make it even harder for the sperm to complete their journey. Recently, some studies have even found that copper IUDs can affect the way the uterus contracts, sending sperm in the wrong direction!

msgid "Egg and sperm travel in opposite directions to meet in (most often) the fallopian tubes. During ovulation, ovaries release an egg into one of the fallopian tubes, and the egg proceeds down the tube toward the uterus, which is being prepared for possible implantation. Part of this preparation involves elevated levels of estrogen and luteinizing hormone (LH). LH triggers the ovaries to release the egg, while higher blood estrogen levels stimulate the vaginal membrane to secrete glycogen, which is then metabolized to lactate. This lowers vaginal pH (to as low as 3.8), creating an acidic environment hostile to pathogens (like the ones that cause sexually transmitted infections). However, this environment can also be toxic to sperm, though the semen (a basic fluid) can buffer the vaginal acidity to preserve sperm cells. As the semen mixes with the vaginal secretions, the pH settles at a point that is not harmful for sperm, and this new environment is the trigger to activate sperm flagella and increase sperms’ motility.

msgid "Fusion also triggers the cortical reaction. When the sperm and egg fuse it triggers a release of calcium ions, which cause the cortical granules inside the egg to fuse with the plasma membrane. As they fuse, these granules release their contents outside of the cell, toward the remains of the zona pellucida. The enzymes of the cortical granules further digest the zona pellucida, making it unable to bind more sperm, while other molecules found in the granules create a new protective layer around the fertilized egg. By creating a new barrier and destroying the initial interface between sperm and egg, the cortical reaction prevents polyspermy, or the fertilization of a single egg by multiple sperm. It’s like entering a hidden temple, but on the way, you set off hidden booby traps that make it impossible to ever enter again. Other sperm reaching the egg now are just shunted away."

msgid "Hundreds of millions of sperm vie for a single egg cell. The sperm cells are streamlined in design for this purpose: a long tail to help them move, lots of mitochondria to power that movement, genetic information to pass on, and enzymatic proteins to get into the egg cell. The proteins are stored in a cap at the front of the sperm known as an acrosome - this is the part that first contacts the egg. The tail is called a flagellum, and it uses the energy made by the mitochondria to move the sperm forward. Flagella use a lot of energy, so they’re kept dormant until sperm enter the vagina. Sperm are haploid; they contain one set of 23 chromosomes. They are created by the cellular division process known as meiosis, which creates 4 sperm from a single germ cell. They’re also very small, only about 50μm long. Sperm are ejaculated in semen, a basic fluid with a pH of about 7.4. "

It’s not smooth sailing just yet – there are still physical and chemical barriers to overcome. As the sperm approach the egg, they bind to the zona pellucida in a process known as sperm binding. This triggers the acrosome reaction, in which the enzymes of the acrosome are freed. These enzymes then begin to digest the zona pellucida and allow the sperm to tunnel toward the egg’s plasma membrane. When the sperm cell finally reaches the egg cell, the plasma membranes of the two cells fuse together and the sperm releases its genetic material into the egg.

msgid "Only about 1 in 1 million sperm that are ejaculated into the vagina will reach the site of fertilization. Estrogen also relaxes the cervix, causes cervical mucus to become watery and more alkaline, and stimulates uterine contractions – all of which help sperm penetrate and navigate the female reproductive system. Relaxing the cervix allows sperm to pass from the vagina into the uterus and reduces a potential physical barrier. Cervical mucus may prevent sperm from passing into the uterus, but during ovulation when the egg is released from the ovaries, the mucus gets thinner and lower in pH. These changes make the mucus a great transport medium for the sperm, and help the sperm continue traveling. The uterine contractions actually help to push sperm toward the correct fallopian tube, and recent studies have suggested that these contractions are more responsible for sperm movement than the sperm’s own propulsion mechanisms! As we can see, the progress of sperm is really influenced by where in the menstrual cycle the female is. The closer to ovulation, the easier it is for sperm to pass. Scientists think this may be to conserve energy and resources - if the female isn’t ovulating, then there’s no target for the sperm, so it makes more sense to focus on protection against pathogens. The vagina and uterus are very susceptible to infection, so the body has to balance on a fine line between protecting these areas and allowing sperm to come through. "

Unlike sperm, the egg has not completed meiosis - it’s stuck in the Metaphase II stage of division. This means that the egg is haploid but with sister chromatids still attached to each other. Also unlike sperm, the meiotic division to create eggs, oogenesis, only makes one viable egg. The egg is covered in a thick outer coating known as the zona pellucida, a layer of carbohydrate-covered proteins that surrounds the plasma membrane. The zona pellucida helps protect the egg and is responsible for mediating the initial meeting of sperm and egg.

The first step in this rolling is the creation of the notochord. The notochord causes the ectoderm above it to form a thick flat plate of cells called the neural plate. The neural plate extends the length of the rostral-caudal axis. The neural plate then bends back on itself and seals itself into a tube known as the neural tube that fits underneath the ectoderm. The borders of where the neural plate had been get pulled under with it, and become the neural crest. The neural tube will become the brain and spinal cord."

The foregut gives rise to the esophagus, stomach, part of the duodenum, and the respiratory bud, which will eventually develop into the lungs. The second half of the duodenum through to the transverse colon arise from the midgut.

msgid "Around day 4, cells continue to divide, but they also begin to differentiate and develop more specific forms and functions. When a cell differentiates, it moves down a certain path toward being a specific type of cell (e.g. an ear cell or a kidney cell), and this process (99% of the time) only goes in one direction. Two layers develop: an outer shell layer known as the *trophoblast*, and an inner collection of cells called the inner cell mass. Rather than being arranged in a solid sphere of cells, the *inner cell mass* is pushed off to one side of the sphere formed by the trophoblast. The rest of the fluid-filled cavity is called the *blastocoel*, and the whole setup resembles a snow globe. The outer trophoblast will develop into structures that help the growing embryo implant in the mother’s uterus. The inner cell mass will continue to differentiate and parts of it will eventually become the embryo, so it is sometimes called the *embryoblast* (the suffix “blast” means “to make”). This is also the time when the zona pellucida begins to disappear, allowing the ball of cells, now called a *blastocyst*, to grow and change shape. In non-mammal animals, the term for this stage is *“blastula”*, but we will stick with terms that apply to human development for the purposes of this discussion."

During the second week, these cells differentiate further into the *epiblast* and the *hypoblast*, which are the two layers of the *bilaminar disc*. This disc is a flat slice across the developing sphere, and splits the environment into two cavities. The hypoblast is the layer facing the blastocoel, while the epiblast is on the other side. Let’s imagine each of these layers as a flat balloon. The balloons expand to fill the space, and become the two new cavities: the *primitive yolk sac* on the side of the epiblast and the *amniotic cavity* on the side of epiblast. The amniotic cavity will eventually surround the fetus."

msgid "The gut tube is the only developmental tube that is supposed to remain an open cylinder. If the neural tube does not close, it creates a life-threatening condition known as spina bifida. Spina bifida can occur due to genetic factors, but may also be caused by a lack of folic acid during pregnancy or if the mother has uncontrolled diabetes. Spina bifida can lead to weakness and paralysis of the legs, bladder and bowel control issues, and other physical problems. Children with spina bifida often struggle academically, potentially due to problems in the development of the central nervous system. While there is no known cure for spina bifida, the introduction of folic acid into everyday foods like cereal and bread has drastically reduced the incidence of neural tube defects in newborns. "

msgid "The zygote’s first priority is dividing to make lots of new cells, so it’s first few days are spent in rapid mitotic division. With each round of diving, it doubles in cell number, so the cell number is increasing at an exponential rate! This division is taking place so quickly that the cells don’t have time to grow, so the 32 cell stage known as the *morula* is the same size as the zygote. At this point, the zona pellucida (a protective membrane of glycoproteins that had surrounded the egg cell) is still intact, which also limits how big it can grow."

msgid "This cut is the primitive streak, and it cuts from the caudal (anus) end in toward the end that will eventually become the head (the rostral end). This streak determines the midline of the body, and separates the left and right sides. Like all dueterostomes, humans have bilateral symmetry, which means that there is a single across which we can split ourselves to make mirror images. What we are actually seeing when we look at a primitive streak are moving cells. They are going from the epiblast and moving down so they end up between the original epiblast layer and the hypoblast. I’ve always imagined the motion like water falling down a waterfall. The first layer to invaginate dives the deepest and ends up closest to the hypoblast – this is the endoderm. The next layers will become the mesoderm, and the cells of the epiblast that continue to border the amniotic cavity are the ectoderm. We now have three germ layers, all of which will contribute to the developing embryo. In the picture below, the anus end is facing us."

"- Some diseases can be traced back to organelle lack / malformation. For example, inclusion-cell (I-cell) disease occurs due to a defect in the Golgi. In order to mark enzymes that should be sent to lysosomes to help degrade unwanted molecules, the Golgi has to bind them with a mannose 6-phosphate tag, like a shipping label. However, in patients with I-cell disease, one of the proteins that make this tag is mutated, and cannot do its job, like a broken label machine. This means that proteins cannot be targeted to lysosomes. These untagged proteins are the enzymes that are responsible for chopping up other proteins. What happens is the inactivated enzymes end up being sent outside the cell, while lysosomes clog up with undigested material. This disease is congenital, and usually fatal before patients reach 7 years of age. \n"
"- An interesting idea is that mitochondria can be used to trace maternal ancestry. Since mitochondria are self-replicating and have their own DNA, they are not determined by the genes found in the nucleus. Instead, your mitochondria have developed from the mitochondria present in the female ovum (egg) that you developed from. Defects in mitochondrial DNA cause hereditary diseases that pass only from mother to children."

"1. __Cytosol__: the proteins that enter the Golgi by mistake are sent back into the cytosol (imagine the barcode scanning wrong and the item being returned). \n"
"2. __Cell membrane__: proteins destined for the cell membrane are processed continuously. Once the vesicle is made, it moves to the cell membrane and fuses with it. Molecules in this pathway are often protein channels which allow molecules into or out of the cell, or cell identifiers which project into the extracellular space and act like a name tag for the cell. \n"
"3. __Secretion__: some proteins are meant to be secreted from the cell to act on other parts of the body. Before these vesicles can fuse with the cell membrane, they must accumulate in number, and require a special chemical signal to be released. This way shipments only go out if they’re worth the cost of sending them (you generally wouldn’t ship just one toy and expect to profit). \n"
"4.  __Lysosome__: The final destination for proteins coming through the Golgi is the lysosome. Vesicles sent to this acidic organelle contain enzymes that will hydrolyze the lysosome’s content."

msgid "A nucleus has interesting implications for how a cell responds to its environment. Thanks to the added protection of the nuclear envelope, the DNA is a little bit more secure from enzymes, pathogens, and potentially harmful products of fat and protein metabolism. Since this is the only permanent copy of the instructions the cell has, it is very important to keep the DNA in good condition. If the DNA was not sequestered away, it would be vulnerable to damage by the aforementioned dangers, which would then lead to defective protein production. Imagine a giant hole or coffee stain in the blueprint for your toy - all of a sudden you don’t have either enough or the right information to make a critical piece of the toy."

msgid "An organelle (think of it as a cell’s internal organ) is a membrane bound structure found within a cell. Just like cells have membranes to hold everything in, these mini-organs are also bound in a double layer of phospholipids to insulate their little compartments within the larger cells. You can think of organelles as smaller rooms within the factory, with specialized conditions to help these rooms carry out their specific task (like a break room stocked with goodies or a research room with cool gadgets and a special air filter). These organelles are found in the cytoplasm, a viscous liquid found within the cell membrane that houses the organelles and is the location of most of the action happening in a cell. Below is a table of the organelles found in the basic human cell, which we’ll be using as our template for this discussion."

You can do all this because you are made of cells — tiny units of life that are like specialized factories, full of machinery designed to accomplish the business of life. Cells make up every living thing, from blue whales to the archaebacteria that live inside volcanos. Just like the organisms they make up, cells can come in all shapes and sizes. Nerve cells in giant squids can reach up to 12m [39 ft] in length, while human eggs (the largest human cells) are about 0.1mm across. Plant cells have protective walls made of cellulose (which also makes up the strings in celery that make it so hard to eat) while fungal cell walls are made from the same stuff as lobster shells. However, despite this vast range in size, shape, and function, all these little factories have the same basic machinery."

For example, plant cells have chloroplasts, organelles that resemble mitochondria and are responsible for turning sunlight into useful energy for the cell (this is like factories that are powered by energy they collect via solar panels). On the other hand, platelets, blood cells responsible for clotting, have no nucleus and are in fact just fragments of cytoplasm contained within a cell membrane."

msgid "The *rough* endoplasmic reticulum is so-called because its surface is studded with ribosomes, the molecules in charge of protein production. When a ribosome finds a specific RNA segment, that segment may tell the ribosome to travel to the rough endoplasmic reticulum and embed itself. The protein created from this segment will find itself inside the lumen of the rough endoplasmic reticulum, where it folds and is tagged with a (usually carbohydrate) molecule in a process known as glycosylation that marks the protein for transport to the Golgi apparatus. The rough endoplasmic reticulum is continuous with the nuclear envelope, and looks like a series of canals near the nucleus. Proteins made in the rough endoplasmic reticulum as destined to either be a part of a membrane, or to be secreted from the cell membrane out of the cell. Without an rough endoplasmic reticulum, it would be a lot harder to distinguish between proteins that should leave the cell, and proteins that should remain. Thus, the rough endoplasmic reticulum helps cells specialize and allows for greater complexity in the organism."

While transcription (making a complementary strand of RNA from DNA) is completed within the nucleus, translation (making protein from RNA instructions) takes place in the cytoplasm.  If there was no barrier between the transcription and translation machineries, it’s possible that poorly-made or unfinished RNA would get turned into poorly made and potentially dangerous proteins. Before an RNA can exit the nucleus to be translated, it must get special modifications, in the form of a cap and tail at either end of the molecule, that act as a stamp of approval to let the cell know this piece of RNA is complete and properly made.

At its most basic, a factory needs a building, a product, and a way to make that product. All cells have membranes (the building), DNA (the various blueprints), and ribosomes (the production line), and so are able to make proteins (the product - let’s say we’re making toys).

msgid "**Secondary active transport** moves multiple molecules across the membrane, powering the uphill movement of one molecule(s) (A) with the downhill movement of the other(s) (B). For example, SGLT2 is a glucose transporter that allows glucose (Molecule A) into our cells (against its gradient) by bringing in a sodium molecule (Molecule B) as well. Remember, sodium wants to get inside the cell, and the energy released by it traveling down its gradient is enough to power glucose into the cell. Since both molecules moved in the same direction, this molecule is known as a **symporter.** Proteins that allow molecules to go in opposite directions are **antiporters** – one great example of this is the sodium/calcium exchanger used to restore cardiomyocyte (heart cell) calcium concentrations after an action potential. An influx of calcium causes the heart to contract, and the antiporter pushes calcium (Molecula A) out against its gradient, while bringing in a sodium ion (Molecule B) to let the heart relax. "

Molecules that practice simple diffusion must be small and nonpolar*, in order to pass through the membrane. Simple diffusion can be disrupted if the diffusion distance is increased. If the alveoli in our lungs fill with fluid (pulmonary edema), the distance the gases must travel increases, and their transport decreases. **Facilitated diffusion** is diffusion that is helped along (facilitated by) a membrane transport channel. These channels are glycoproteins (proteins with carbohydrates attached) that allow molecules to pass through the membrane. These channels are almost always specific for either a certain molecule or a certain type of molecule (i.e. an ion channel), and so they are tightly linked to certain physiologic functions. For example, one such transporter channel, GLUT4, is incredibly important in diabetes. GLUT4 is a glucose transporter found in fat and skeletal muscle. Insulin triggers GLUT4 to insert into the membranes of these cells so that glucose can be taken in from the blood. Since this is a passive mechanism, the amount of sugar entering our cells is proportional to how much sugar we consume, up to the point that all our channels are being used (saturation). In type II diabetes mellitus, cells do not respond as well to the presence of insulin, and so do not insert GLUT4 into their membranes. This can lead to soaring blood glucose levels which can cause heart disease, stroke, and kidney failure."

msgid "Diffusion is the movement of particles down their gradient. A gradient is any imbalance in concentration, and moving down a gradient just means that the particle is trying to be evenly distributed everywhere, like dropping food coloring in water. This is what happened when we made our granola - a bunch of separate ingredients came together and spread out across the whole mixture. We call this evening-out moving “downhill”, and it doesn’t require energy. The molecule most likely to be involved in simple diffusion is water - it can easily pass through cell membranes. When water undergoes simple diffusion, it is known as **osmosis**."

msgid "So how do cells maintain different concentrations of proteins and molecules despite the pressures on them to be homogenous? Cell membranes are semipermeable, meaning they have control over what molecules can or cannot pass through. Some molecules can just drift in and out, others require special structures to get in and out of a cell, while some molecules even need an energy boost to get across a cell membrane. Each cell’s membrane contains the right mix of these structures to help that cell keep its internal environment just right."

msgid "Sometimes the body needs to move molecules against their gradient. This is known as moving “uphill”, and requires energy from the cell - imagine how much easier it is to shake the trail mix together than it would be to then separate all the pieces again. This is most obvious in the sodium-potassium pump (Na+/K+ ATPase) that helps maintain resting potential in the cell. This protein uses the energy released from hydrolysis of ATP (adenosine triphosphate) to pump three sodium ions out of and two potassium ions into the cell. ATP is an energy molecule, and when hydrolysis happens, it gets broken down to release the energy that was stored in its chemical bonds. Transport that directly uses ATP for energy is considered **primary active transport**. In this case, that’s moving sodium from a concentration of 10mM to one of 145 mM. A similar gradient is being surpassed with potassium, whose intracellular and extracellular concentrations are 140mM and 5mM, respectively. Since these types of transporters are so costly in terms of energy, they are relatively rare. One other location for such an ATP pump is the proton/potassium exchanger (H+/K+ ATPase) found in the stomach. These proton pumps are responsible for creating the acidic environment of the stomach, and can cause acid reflux. Proton pump inhibitors like omeprazole are prescribed to patients with ulcers or acid reflux to help reduce the acidity of their gut."

This is one major explanation for why the sodium/potassium pump is so important – that one molecule helps set up the needed gradient to allow for the movement of many chemicals into and out of the cell. In fact, this relationship is taken advantage of in certain heart disease medications. Digoxin is given to patient with atrial fibrillation (abnormal, fast heart rate) and it inhibits the sodium/potassium pump. This leads to the accumulation of intracellular sodium, which actually causes the sodium/calcium pump to change directions! Now sodium is being pumped out and calcium being brought in – making heart contractions stronger."

msgid " Viruses can also have surface receptors which can be specific to those on the macrophage. Viruses need to access the host cell’s cytoplasm or nucleus in order to replicate and cause an infection, so they use their surface receptors to interact with immune system cells and exploit the immune response for entry into the cell. Sometimes, when a virus and a host cell interact, the host cell is able to successfully destroy the virus and stop the spread of infection. Other times, the host cell engulfs the virus, and the virus tricks the cell, gaining access to what it needs to replicate. Once this happens, the infected cell is identified and destroyed by other cells of the immune system in order to stop viral replication and infection."

Some cells can use various methods, such as ion pumps, voltage-gated channels, or osmosis, to pull smaller molecules and chemicals across the plasma membrane and into their cytoplasm. But larger objects, like viruses, bacteria, or other particles are too large to use small channels to transport through the plasma membrane.

Antibiotics, for example, are used to treat bacterial infections, and are useless at dealing with a viral infection like the flu or chickenpox. Antibiotics target certain parts of bacteria in the hopes of killing them; with viruses it’s hard to kill something that isn’t quite alive to begin with. Instead of destroying the virus, antiviral medicines try to shut off the replication cycle, like shutting down the android production line."

msgid "Adaptation and evolution happen through unintentional changes (mutations) that are advantageous to an entire species. Viruses definitely adapt to their surroundings. Unlike the previous requirement, which required an immediate response, adaptation is a process that takes place over time.  A virus can live in two different phases – the lytic phase (where the virus actively replicates in a host cell) and the lysogenic phase (where the viral DNA incorporate itself into the cell’s DNA and multiples whenever the cell multiplies). Sometimes a host does not have enough energy or supplies to support the virus to actively replicate, so it will switch to the lysogenic phase. The virus can eventually reenter the lytic phase when conditions are right. This ability to adapt is what makes human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) as hard to treat as it is. HIV mutates quickly because it makes frequent mistakes while replicating its genome. Because the virus is constantly changing, it makes it very hard to design drugs and vaccines against it. One drug might prevent a large number of virions from replicating, but just a few will be unaffected. Those surviving virions will continue to infect more cells, making copies of the resistant strains. "

msgid "Homeostasis is all about balance – can something control its internal temperature, or its internal contents? In earlier drafts of criteria for life, the requirement was that living things must be made of cells. Viruses are not made out of cells. A single virus particle is known as a virion, and is made up of a set of genes bundled within a protective protein shell called a capsid. Certain virus strains will have an extra membrane (lipid bilayer) surrounding it called an envelope. Viruses do not have nuclei, organelles, or cytoplasm like cells do, and so they have no way to monitor or create change in their internal environment. This criterion asks whether an individual virion is capable maintaining a steady-state internal environment on its own. Though some have argued that the capsid and envelope help virions resist change in their environment, the general consensus is that viruses do not pass this first requirement for life. Still, very few things in biology are black and white, so let’s check out how viruses do with the rest of the list before we make our final decision. "

While our immune system could certainly handle a single virion, it’s the hundreds of thousands of virions created in a short period of time that harm our cells. Viruses must use host cells to create more virions. Since viruses don’t have organelles, nuclei, or even ribosomes, they don’t have the tools they need to copy their genes, much less create whole new virions. Instead, viruses enter living cells and then hijack the host’s cellular equipment to copy viral genetic information, build new capsids, and assemble everything together. We use the term replicate, instead of reproduce, to indicate viruses need a host cell to multiply."

msgid "Acetic acid is an example of another class of organic molecules called a *carboxylic acid*. The overall reaction shows how an alcohol is oxidized in biochemistry. Now there are various definitions for oxidation, but the one I want to use is “oxidation is the gain of oxygen”. Actually, the very first scientists to discover oxidation and the opposite reaction, reduction, studied the addition and removal or oxygen. This definition works well here because you can see that the alcohol molecule has gained an oxygen atom. The overall change is from –OH to –OOH. "

msgid "Now that we know what a molecule of ethanol looks like, let us think about what happens when we drink a glass of beer. Firstly, ethanol is completely soluble in water (it mixes throughout the water in our body to form a uniform solution). For example, when you combine beer and lemonade together they completely mix. Lemonade is basically flavored water. If beer wasn’t soluble in lemonade it wouldn’t mix together and you would see distinct layers between the two liquids. Have you noticed what happens when you shake a bottle of salad dressing (that constituents oil and vinegar), and then let it sit for a while; the layers of oil and vinegar separate out. This illustrates oil is not soluble in water, but alcohol definitely is. Our bodies are about 60% water and when we drink a glass of beer, the ethanol molecules quickly absorb into our bloodstream through the stomach and the small intestines. Once in the blood, the ethanol moves all around the body rapidly affecting the brain and we know “what” happens then!"

msgid "Now you may be wondering if the overall reaction is the main deal, why bother to even show the first step to acetaldehyde. Great thought! Acetaldehyde is one of the chemicals responsible for the symptoms of a hangover. It isn’t the only chemical that does this, but it is considered a major contributor. Acetaldehyde is toxic to our body and it is therefore important that it gets further oxidized to acetic acid as quickly as possible. Acetaldehyde rapidly widens our blood vessels (vasodilation) to cause a flushing to the skin. At the same time, we start to experience headaches and other unpleasant effects of a hangover. How bad the hangover is largely depends on how quickly the body can get from the acetaldehyde to the harmless acetic acid (the acid found in vinegar).  Drinking too many alcoholic drinks results in more acetaldehyde in our body than can be broken down. This buildup is caused because our enzymes cannot process it through quickly enough."

msgid "Before we get into the discussion of cyclic hemiacetals and hemiacetals, let’s just quickly recollect how they are formed. They are formed when an alcohol oxygen atom adds to the carbonyl carbon of an aldehyde or a ketone. This happens through the nucleophilic attack of the hydroxyl group at the electrophilic carbonyl group. Since alcohols are weak nucleophiles, the attack on the carbonyl carbon is usually promoted by protonation of the carbonyl oxygen. When this reaction takes place with an aldehyde, the product is called a ‘hemiacetal’; and when this reaction takes place with a ketone, the product is referred to as a ‘hemiketal’."

msgid "In aqueous solution, glucose exists in both the open and closed forms. These two forms always exist in equilibrium. In the process of converting from closed to open form and then back to closed form, the C-1→ C-2 bond rotates. This rotation produces either of the two anomers. We term this phenomenon of opening of the ring, rotation of the C-1→ C-2 bond and the subsequent closing of the ring as mutarotation.  So as a result of mutarotation, both the α and β anomers are present in equilibrium in solution. In the case of glucose, β anomer is more predominant than α anomer. This may not be the case with all the monosaccharides. "

"In biochemistry, enzymes act as catalysts for any chemical reaction; and the class of enzyme that catalyzes aldol reactions is called, quite intuitively, 'aldolase'. \n"
"Let’s now discuss the first step of Kreb’s cycle: acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl CoA) condenses with oxaloacetate to produce (S)-Citryl CoA through an aldol mechanism. Here, instead of an aldehyde or a ketone, a thioester acts as the nucleophilic partner as illustrated below in the reaction mechanism."

msgid "It is important to emphasize that aldol reactions are highly reversible in nature; in most cases, the energy levels of reactants and products are not very different.  Thus, depending on the metabolic conditions, aldolases can also catalyze *retro-aldol* reactions (i.e. the reverse of aldol reactions, in which a carbon-carbon bond is broken).  As a typical example; fructose 1,6-bisphosphate aldolase is involved in two divergent pathways."

msgid "Now let’s discuss a particular reaction that takes place in the gluconeogenesis (sugar building) biochemical pathway. It’s the reaction between two 3-carbon containing sugars, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (GAP) and dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP), to form a six-carbon product, fructose 1,6-bisphosphate. This particular reaction also follows an aldol reaction mechanism, and is catalyzed by the enzyme, fructose 1,6-bisphosphate aldolase. This enzyme belongs to '*Class II' aldolase*, in which a metal cation - generally Zn$^{2+}$, is bound in the active site of the enzyme. This helps to stabilize the negative charge of the enolate intermediate formed (as will be illustrated in the mechanism below). "

The carbonyl group (C=O) gets polarized (i.e. there is a charge separation), since oxygen is more electronegative than carbon and pulls the electron density towards itself. As a result, the carbon atom develops a partial positive charge (δ+) and the oxygen atom develops a partial negative charge (δ-). In some cases, *in the vicinity of a strong electrophile*, the partially negatively charged carbonyl oxygen (δ-) can act as a nucleophile and attack the electrophile (as you will notice in the example of acid chloride synthesis, discussed later in this tutorial)."

In the first step, the base abstracts a proton (H$^\\text{+}$) from the carboxylic acid to form the corresponding carboxylate anion (**1**). The carboxylate anion's negatively charged oxygen attacks the considerably electrophilic acyl chloride's carbonyl carbon. As a result, a tetrahedral intermediate (**2**) is formed. In the final step, chloride - a good leaving group - is eliminated from the tetrahedral intermediate to yield the acid anhydride."

msgid "2. **Hydrogen bonding:** This is a special kind of dipole-dipole interaction that occurs specifically between a hydrogen atom bonded to either an oxygen, nitrogen, or fluorine atom. The partially positive end of hydrogen is attracted to the partially negative end of the oxygen, nitrogen, or fluorine of another molecule. Hydrogen bonding is a relatively strong force of attraction between molecules, and considerable energy is required to break hydrogen bonds. This explains the exceptionally high boiling points and melting points of compounds like water, $\\text{H}_{2}\\text{O}$, and hydrogen fluoride, $\\text{HF}$.

For example, bromine, $\\text{Br}_{2}$, has more electrons than chlorine, $\\text{Cl}_{2}$, so bromine will have stronger London dispersion forces than chlorine, resulting in a higher boiling point for bromine, 59 $^\\text{o}$C, compared to chlorine, –35 $^\\text{o}$C. Also, the breaking of London dispersion forces doesn’t require that much energy, which explains why nonpolar covalent compounds like methane—$\\text{CH}_{4}$—oxygen, and nitrogen—which only have London dispersion forces of attraction between the molecules—freeze at very low temperatures."

msgid "Exactly the same situation exists in molecules. Just imagine the towels to be real atoms, such as hydrogen and chlorine. These two atoms are bound to each other through a polar covalent bond—analogous to the thread. Each hydrogen chloride molecule in turn is bonded to the neighboring hydrogen chloride molecule through a dipole-dipole attraction—analogous to Velcro. We’ll talk about dipole-dipole interactions in detail a bit later. The polar covalent bond is much stronger in strength than the dipole-dipole interaction. The former is termed an *intramolecular attraction* while the latter is termed an *intermolecular attraction*."

msgid "Exceptions to the octet rule include hydrogen (H) and helium (He) that follow the duet rule instead. They are the first two elements of the periodic table and have a single electron shell which accommodates only 2 electrons. Other exceptions include some group 3 elements like boron (B) that contain three valence electrons. Theoretically, boron can accommodate five more electrons according to the octet rule, but boron is a very small atom and five non-metal atoms (like hydrogen) cannot pack around the boron nucleus. Thus, boron commonly forms three bonds, BH$\\text{}_{3}$, with a total of six electrons in the outermost shell. This also results in some anomalous properties for boron compounds because they are kind of “short of electrons”. It should be thus noted that covalent bonding between non-metals can occur to form compounds with less than an octet on each atom.  "

Because they have the same electronegativity, they will share their valence electrons equally with each other. This type of a covalent bond where electrons are shared equally between two atoms is called a *non-polar covalent bond*.  "

msgid "Methane (CH$\\text{}_{4}$) is an example of a compound where non-polar covalent bonds are formed between two different atoms. One carbon atom forms four covalent bonds with four hydrogen atoms by sharing a pair of electron between itself and each hydrogen (H) atom. The electronegativity value for carbon (C) and hydrogen (H) is 2.55 and 2.1 respectively, so the difference in their electronegativity values is only 0.45 (<0.5 criteria); the electrons are thus equally shared between carbon and hydrogen. So we can conveniently say that a molecule of methane has a total of four non-polar covalent bonds."

msgid "As depicted above, the analyte is loaded over the silica bed (packed in the column) and allowed to adhere to the silica. Here, silica acts as the stationary phase. Solvent (mobile phase) is then made to flow through the silica bed (under gravity or pressure). The different components of the analyte exhibit varying degrees of adhesion to the silica (see later), and as a result they travel at different speeds through the stationary phase as the solvent flows through it, indicated by the separation of the different bands. *The components that adhere more strongly to the stationary phase travel more slowly compared to those with a weaker adhesion*. Analytical chromatography can be used to purify compounds ranging from milligram to gram scale."

Once the column was packed, and the solvent volume above the bed reduced to less than 5 mm, I carefully poured the reaction mixture over the bed of silica from the top of the column, with the aid of a glass pipette. I opened the stopcock and let the solvent run slowly through the column. I constantly kept adding solvent from the top of the glass column.

msgid "There are several types of chromatography, each differing in the kind of stationary and mobile phase they use. The underlying principle though remains the same: *differential affinities of the various components of the analyte towards the stationary and mobile phases results in the differential separation of the components*. Again, the mode of interaction of the various components with the stationary and mobile phases may change depending on the chromatographic technique used. The commonly used chromatographic techniques are tabulated below."

msgid "‘A’, being polar in nature, will adsorb on to the polar stationary phase (silica). ‘B’ being non-polar in nature, will readily dissolve in the non-polar mobile phase (hexane) without adhering to silica, and will thus elute out of the column with hexane. Once B is eluted out, the mobile phase will be changed to something polar like acetonitrile. By doing so we will now force A to detach from the silica and dissolve in the polar solvent, acetonitrile, and get eluted out of the column with acetonitrile. This is illustrated in the diagram below."

For α-ketoglutarate and glutamate, we can round up to the denominator to 150.  Our value for glutamate is clearly below ½ and since we are looking for the greatest value, we can eliminate this answer choice.  For the remaining two compounds, 80/150 is close to ½ since 75/150 equals ½, and 80/130 must be larger since only the denominator changes between the two, i.e. 80/130 > 80/150."

Let’s rotate compound 1 around one axis of rotation, and see if any of the products of rotation lead to compound 2. If not, then compound 1 is chiral. So let’s go ahead and sequentially rotate compound 1 about the C-X axis in a clockwise direction. The various products of rotation are shown below. "

msgid "Some drugs are marketed solely as a pure single enantiomer (that is; the drug preparation has no contamination with the other enantiomer). **Enantiomeric excess (ee)** is a measurement of the degree of purity of any chiral sample. It reflects the degree to which a sample contains one enantiomer in excess over the other. A racemic mixture has an ee of 0% (both enantiomers are present in a 1:1 ratio), while a completely pure enantiomer has an ee of 100%. As an example, if a sample contains 70% of *R* isomer and 30% of *S* isomer, then it will have an enantiomeric excess of 40%. This can be rationalized as a mixture of 40% pure *R* with 60% (30% *R* and 30% *S*) of a racemic mixture. "

In other words, it would be inconceivable that this process could be reversed without tampering with the external conditions (you will have to put water in the freezer to force it to form ice).

Saucepan, with the lid, prevents any addition of mass to it or removal of mass from it; whereas in the case of the saucepan, without the lid, we can easily add coffee and sugar from outside and thus change the mass of the contents.

"Let’s first define what ‘thermal equilibrium’ is. When two systems are in contact with each other and no energy flow takes place between them, then the two systems are said to be in thermal equilibrium with each other. In simple words, thermal equilibrium means that the two systems are at the same temperature.\n"
"Thermal equilibrium is a concept that is so integral to our daily lives. For instance, let's say you have a bowl of hot soup and you put it in the freezer. What will happen to the soup?\n"
"The soup will, of course, start cooling down with time. You all know that. And you also probably know that the soup will continue to cool down until it reaches the same temperature as the freezer. Even if you are familiar with this concept, what you may not realize is that this is an excellent example of thermal equilibrium. Here, heat flows from the system at a higher temperature (bowl of soup) to the system at a lower temperature (freezer). Heat flow stops when the two systems reach the same temperature. In other words, now the two systems are in thermal equilibrium with each other and there is no more heat flow taking place between the two systems.\n"

The consequence of this law is that any thermal motion ceases in a perfect crystal at 0 K.

msgid "Thermodynamics is a very important branch of both physics and chemistry. It deals with the study of energy, the conversion of energy between different forms and the ability of energy to do work. As you go through this article, I am pretty sure that you will begin to appreciate the importance of thermodynamics and you will start noticing how laws of thermodynamics operate in your daily lives! There are essentially four laws of thermodynamics."

msgid "__Indicator__: For the purposes of this tutorial, it’s good enough to know that an indicator is a weak acid or base that is added to the analyte solution, and it changes color when the equivalence point is reached i.e. the point at which the amount of titrant added is just enough to completely neutralize the analyte solution. The point at which the indicator changes color is called the endpoint. So the addition of an indicator to the analyte solution helps us to visually spot the equivalence point in an acid-base titration. "

msgid "Certain groups in society are less powerful than others. Sociologists refer to those who do the discriminating as the *dominant group.* This dominant group is the group with the most power, greatest privilege, and highest social status. This does not mean that the dominant group is the majority group in terms of numbers. A small dominant group can still hold power over the majority. On the other hand, *minority groups* are people who are singled out for unequal treatment and who see themselves as objects of collective discrimination. These minority groups are often *marginalized*. This means they are confined to an unimportant or powerless position within a society. Marginalized groups are socially excluded, disadvantaged, and often at the fringe of society."

msgid "Did you know that Facebook now includes up to 50 gender options? The terms *cisgender* or *cissexual* (often abbreviated as *cis*), describe gender identity *perceptions*, where a person’s *experiences* of their own gender agree with the sex they were *assigned* at birth. This is a new definition of gender which incorporates elements of gender identity. In short, cisgender refers to individual who have a match between the gender they were assigned with at birth, their bodies, and their personal identity. For example, *cis male* refers to ‘male assigned male’ at birth, and *cis female* refers to ‘female assigned female at birth’. You can see the different categories in the table below! Since it is a social media platform, it can offer nuanced gender identification categories. In a census survey however, it would be difficult to achieve the same."

msgid "Everywhere we look, we see differences in wealth, power, and status. Some groups have higher status and greater privilege than others. This inequality in the system is what we call *social stratification*. In this unequal social system, there is often unfair treatment directed against certain individuals or social groups. This is referred to as *discrimination*. Discrimination can be based on many different characteristics—age, gender, weight, ethnicity, religion, or even politics. For example, prejudice and discrimination based on race is called *racism*. Oftentimes, gender prejudice or discrimination is referred to as sexism. Discrimination is often the outcome of *prejudice*—a pre-formed negative judgment or attitude. Prejudice leads people to view certain individuals or groups as inferior."

In recent years, there has been a movement to include third gender categories. *Third gender* is defined as a gender category for those who do not identify with either male or female gender categories. Many countries now recognize a third gender on their census, including India and Nepal! This is a sign of the recognition of citizens’ choice of gender identity. Third gender or neutral bathrooms are also now available in many university campuses around the US."

msgid "Including third genders in census surveys is very important. Did you know that currently we don’t know the true size of the transgender population? When someone is a member of a marginalized group, they are often overlooked, and oftentimes, that also means they are at risk of being underserved. The National Transgender Discrimination Survey shows that 71 percent of 6,450 respondents said that they hid their gender or gender transition to avoid discrimination. Research also showed that homeless transgender people were sleeping on benches because homeless shelters were separated by female and male genders. Because of this, transgendered people may not be included in city evaluations of who needs shelter assistance. This also affects how health, medical, and other social services can be provided for marginalized groups."

msgid "Each vesicle packet released from the pre-synaptic neuron will contain a set amount of neurotransmitters, which will then bind to some of the receptors on the post-synaptic cell. If the neurotransmitter is excitatory, the influx of positive ions will depolarize (bring closer to zero) the cell body. If the neurotransmitter is inhibitory, it will hyperpolarize the cell body. However, a single vesicle of neurotransmitter isn’t enough to depolarize the cell body. Most of the time, all the vesicles released from an action potential aren’t enough to trigger an action potential in the following cell. This is why the brain uses neuron networks to send many signals to a single cell, or why a neuron may have to fire a couple times before it can pass the message along. There might even be competition among the neurons, with a single post-synaptic neuron receiving glutamate from one pre-synaptic neuron and GABA from its neighbor. The post-synaptic cell will only send the message along if it gets enough excitatory input to depolarize across the threshold, and open the voltage-gated ion channels in its axon."

Synapses between neurons are either excitatory or inhibitory – and that all comes down to the neurotransmitter released. Excitatory neurotransmitters cause the signal to propagate - more action potentials are triggered. Inhibitory signals work to cancel the signal. Every time an action potential is triggered in a neuron, that cell will release whatever types of neurotransmitter it has, because calcium cannot tell the difference between one vesicle and another. So neurons tend to have only one type of neurotransmitter – either excitatory OR inhibitory."

Botulism is caused by the bacteria *Clostridum botulinum* which secretes a chemical known as botulinum toxin that destroys the membrane and vesicle proteins involved in neurotransmitter release at the neuromuscular junction – causing weakness and fatigue. With no vesicle fusion, muscle cells do not get the signal to move. Botulinum toxin is the major ingredient of Botox, which is used in cosmetic procedures."

msgid "While this is the basic signalling method, there can be more nuance sometimes. Cells in the basal ganglia, for example, can release GABA and Substance P, but each neuron will always release both together, never just one or the other. This can help make the commands to the receiving cells more complicated, or reach a wider network of cells – both the ones that respond to GABA and the ones that response to Substance P."

msgid "Your brain is a hotbed of electrochemical activity. About 100 billion neurons are each firing off 5-50 messages (action potentials) per second. This activity allows you to process your environment, move your muscles, and even keep your balance! If you touch something slimy, that information goes from your fingertips to your brain, and then your brain says “eww, no!” and sends information to your fingertips telling them to move away. The same thing happens when you trip and you’re about to fall, or a bright light flashes in your eyes. Your brain receives information about where you are in space, or the brightness of the light, and responds accordingly. And it’s in our best interests that this action-reaction process goes quickly – so that we can catch ourselves as we fall, or shut our eyes tight. The process of sending these signals takes place in two steps: along the cell (action potential) and between cells (neurotransmitters)."

msgid "* Demyelination diseases that degrade the myelin coating on cells include Guillain-Barre syndrome and Multiple Sclerosis. Guillain-Barre syndrome is the destruction of Schwann cells (in the peripheral nervous system), while MS is caused by a loss of oligodendrocytes (in the brain and spinal column). These disorders have different causes and presentations, but both involve muscle weakness and numbness or tingling. These symptoms occur because the nerves aren’t sending information the right way. When the myelin coating of nerves degenerates, the signals are either diminished or completely destroyed. If the nerves are afferent (sensory) fibers, the destruction of myelin leads to numbness or tingling, because sensations aren’t traveling the way they should. When efferent (motor) nerves are demyelinated, this can lead to weakness because the brain is expending a lot of energy but is still unable to actually move the affected limbs. Limbs are especially affected, because they have the longest nerves, and the longer the nerve, the more myelin it has that can potentially be destroyed."

Smaller fibers without myelin, like the ones carrying pain information, carry signals at about 0.5-2.0 m/s (1.1-4.5 miles per hour). The fastest signals in our bodies are sent by larger, myelinated axons found in neurons that transmit the sense of touch or proprioception – 80-120 m/s (179-268 miles per hour). Scientists believe that this reflects the evolution of these senses - pain was among the most important things to sense, and so was the first to develop through small, simple nerves.

"A myelin sheath also decreases the capacitance of the neuron in the area it covers. Since the neuron is at a negative membrane potential, it’s got a lot of agitated negative ions that don’t have a positive ion nearby to balance them out. Like charges repel, so the negative ions spread out as far from each other as they can, to the very outer edges of the axon, near the membrane. This then attracts positive ions outside the cell to the membrane as well, and helps the ions in a way, calm down. We then end up with thin layers of negative ions inside of the cell membrane and positive ions outside the cell membrane.\n"
"However, where myelin wraps around the cell, it provides a thick layer between the inside and the outside of the cell.  Fewer negative ions gather at those points because it is further away from the positive charges. Now there are parts of the axon that are still negative, but contain proportionally far fewer negative ions. This means that as the action potential comes rushing by, it is easier to depolarize the areas that are sheathed, because there are fewer negative ions to counteract."

In the central nervous system, oligodendrocytes are responsible for insulation. These cells wrap around the axon, creating several layers insulation. As our action potential travels down the membrane, sometimes ions are lost as they cross the membrane and exit the cell.

"##Consider the following\n"
"One of the main characteristics that differentiates an action potential from a different kind of electrical signal called graded potentials is that the action potential is the major signal sent down the axon, while graded potentials at the dendrites and cell body vary in size and influence whether an action potential will be sent or not. Graded potentials are small changes in membrane potential that are either excitatory (depolarize the membrane) or inhibitory (hyperpolarize the membrane). Many excitatory graded potentials have to happen at once to depolarize the cell body enough to trigger the action potential. "

"- Absolute refractory period: during this time it is absolutely impossible to send another action potential. The inactivation (h) gates of the sodium channels lock shut for a time, and make it so no sodium will pass through. No sodium means no depolarization, which means no action potential. Absolute refractory periods help direct the action potential down the axon, because only channels further downstream can open and let in depolarizing ions.\n"
"- Relative refractory period: during this time, it is really hard to send an action potential. This is the period after the absolute refractory period, when the h gates are open again. However, the cell is still hyperpolarized after sending an action potential. It would take even more positive ions than usual to reach the appropriate depolarization potential than usual. This means that the initial triggering event would have to be bigger than normal in order to send more action potentials along. Relative refractory periods can help us figure how intense a stimulus is - cells in your retina will send signals faster in bright light than in dim light, because the trigger is stronger."

msgid "0.  A triggering event occurs that depolarizes the cell body. This signal comes from other cells connecting to the neuron, and it causes positively charged ions to flow into the cell body. Positive ions still flow into the cell to depolarize it, but these ions pass through channels that open when a specific chemical, known as a neurotransmitter, binds to the channel and tells it to open. Neurotransmitters are released by cells near the dendrites, often as the end result of their own action potential! These incoming ions bring the membrane potential closer to 0, which is known as depolarization. An object is polar if there is some difference between more negative and more positive areas. As positive ions flow into the negative cell, that difference, and thus the cell’s polarity, decrease. If the cell body gets positive enough that it can trigger the voltage-gated sodium channels found in the axon, then the action potential will be sent. "

These gated channels are different from the leakage channels, and only open once an action potential has been triggered.

How quickly these signals fire tells us how strong the original stimulus is - the stronger the signal, the higher the frequency of action potentials. There is a maximum frequency at which a single neuron can send action potentials, and this is determined by its refractory periods."

Molecular mimicry of a self‐antigen by an infectious pathogen, such as bacteria and viruses, may trigger autoimmune disease due to a cross-reactive immune response against the infection. One example of an organism that uses molecular mimicry to hide from immunological defenses is *Streptococcus* infection."

The process of rearrangement allows for a lot of binding diversity. This diversity could potentially lead to accidental attacks against self cells and molecules because some rearrangement configurations can accidentally mimic a person’s self molecules and proteins. Mature T cells should recognize only foreign antigens combined with self-MHC molecules in order to mount an appropriate immune response."

msgid "- Countercurrent multiplication in the kidneys is the process of using energy to generate an *osmotic gradient* that enables you to reabsorb water from the tubular fluid and produce concentrated urine. This mechanism prevents you from producing litres and litres of dilute urine every day, and is the reason why you don’t need to be continually drinking in order to stay hydrated. "

"- The *thin descending* limb is passively permeable to both water and small solutes such as sodium chloride and urea. As active reabsorption of solutes from the ascending limb of the loop of Henle increases the concentration of solutes within the interstitial space (space between cells), water and solutes move down their concentration gradients until their concentrations within the descending tubule and the interstitial space have equilibrated. As such, water moves out of the tubular fluid and solutes to move in. This means, the tubular fluid becomes steadily more concentrated or hyperosmotic (compared to blood) as it travels down the thin descending limb of the tubule. \n"
"- The *thin ascending* limb is passively permeable to small solutes, but impermeable to water, which means water cannot escape from this part of the loop. As a result, solutes move out of the tubular fluid, but water is retained and the tubular fluid becomes steadily more dilute or hyposmotic as it moves up the ascending limb of the tubule.\n"
"- The *thick ascending* limb actively reabsorbs sodium, potassium and chloride. this segment is also impermeable to water, which again means that water cannot escape from this part of the loop. This segment is sometimes called the  “diluting segment”. "

"1. *The single effect*. The single effect is driven by active transport of sodium chloride out of the tubular fluid in the thick ascending limb into the interstitial fluid, which becomes hyperosmotic. As a result, water moves passively down its concentration gradient out of the tubular fluid in the descending limb into the interstitial space, until it reaches equilibrium.  \n"
"2. *Fluid flow*. As urine is continually being produced, new tubular fluid enters the descending limb, which pushes the fluid at higher osmolarity down the tube and an osmotic gradient begins to develop. "

Because the blood flow through these capillaries is very slow, any solutes that are reabsorbed into the bloodstream have time to diffuse back into the interstitial fluid, which maintains the solute concentration gradient in the medulla.

Fluid leaving the ascending limb of the loop of Henle enters the distal convoluted tubule, where its composition is further adjusted, and then drains into collecting tubules. These tubules empty into collecting ducts that descend back through the medulla, and eventually connect to the ureter, which transports urine to the bladder. "

msgid "The kidneys are able to separate the reabsorption of water and solutes in the loop of Henle, distal nephron and collecting ducts. This means urine can be made more concentrated or more dilute than plasma, depending on how hydrated you are. This process is mainly controlled by antidiuretic hormone, a hormone that is made in the hypothalamus of the brain and stored in the pituitary gland. The release of antidiuretic hormone by the pituitary gland is controlled by sensors in your heart and blood vessels that detect drops in blood pressure, or increased concentrations of salt in your bloodstream that may occur when you are dehydrated. If you have ever felt dehydrated after having a few glasses of wine or beer, this is because alcohol inhibits the release of antidiuretic hormone, which increases urine production.  "

Nephrons can be thought of in sections, each with a different structure and function. These are the glomerulus, the proximal tubule, the loop of Henle, the distal tubule, and the collecting duct. The loop of Henle is a hairpin-like structure comprised of a thin descending limb, a thin ascending limb and a thick ascending limb.

msgid "* *Neural (nervous system) control and hormonal control* - these *extrinsic* mechanisms can override renal autoregulation and decrease the glomerular filtration rate when necessary. For example if you have a large drop in blood pressure, which can happen if you lose a lot of blood, your nervous system will stimulate contraction of the afferent arteriole, reducing urine production. If further measures are needed your nervous system can also activate the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, a hormone system that regulates blood pressure and fluid balance."

msgid "Blood that is about to be filtered enters a glomerulus, which is a *tuft* of blood capillaries (the smallest of blood vessels). The glomerulus is nestled inside a cup-like sac located at the end of each nephron, called a glomerular capsule. Glomerular capillaries have small pores in their walls, just like a very fine mesh sieve. Most capillary beds are sandwiched between arterioles and venules (the small vessels delivering blood too and collecting blood from capillary beds), and the hydrostatic pressure drops as blood travels through the capillary bed into the venules and veins.The glomerulus, on the other hand, is sandwiched between two arterioles - afferent arterioles deliver blood to the glomerulus, while efferent arterioles carry it away. Constriction of efferent arterioles as blood exits the glomerulus provides resistance to blood flow, preventing a pressure drop, which could not be achieved if blood were to flow into venules, which do not really constrict. The two arterioles change in size to increase or decrease blood pressure in the glomerulus. In addition, efferent arterioles are smaller in diameter than afferent arterioles. As a result, pressurized blood enters the glomerulus through a relatively wide tube, but is forced to exit through a narrower tube. Together, these unique features plus the fact that your heart is supplying your kidneys with over a liter of blood per minute (around 20% of its output) maintain a high glomerular capillary pressure capillary pressure and the filtration function of the kidney, regardless of fluctuations in blood flow. For example, the sympathetic nervous system can stimulate the efferent arteriole to constrict during exercise when blood flow to the kidney is reduced. "

msgid "- Diabetes insipidus is a rare disorder that causes you to feel very thirsty (despite drinking a lot), and to produce large amounts of urine. It is usually caused by a malfunction in the production of antidiuretic hormone (ADH), a hormone that prevents the production of dilute urine (i.e., retains water in the body). This can happen for a number of different reasons, including damage to the pituitary; e.g., caused by a tumour, surgery, or an infection, that disrupts the normal production, storage and release of ADH. However, it may also occur due to a defect in the tubules themselves that prevents them from responding to ADH, or during pregnancy, when a placental enzyme destroys ADH in the mother. "

Retention of waste products causes disturbances in multiple organ systems including cardiovascular, hematological, gastrointestinal, neurological, skeletal, hormonal, respiratory, skin and reproductive systems. Loss of water and electrolyte homeostasis lead to elevated extracellular body fluid volume, which may produce edema and hypertension, reduced phosphate excretion, loss of bone calcium, and symptoms of lethargy, nausea, diarrhoea and vomiting.

msgid "Nephrons are comprised of different segments that perform specific functions. The walls of the nephron are made of a single layer of cube-like cells, called cuboidal epithelial cells, and their ultrastructure changes depending on the function of the segment they are in. For example, the surface of the cells facing the lumen of the proximal convoluted tubule are covered in microvilli (tiny finger-like structures). This type of surface is called a brush border. The brush border and the extensive length of the proximal tubule dramatically increase the surface area available for reabsorption of substances into the blood enabling around 80% of the glomerular filtrate to be reabsorbed in this segment. Another notable feature of these cells is that they are densely packed with mitochondria (the cell’s energy generators). The mitochondria ensure a good supply of energy is available to fuel the active transport systems needed for efficient reabsorption. "

Well we know that acceleration is the change in velocity over the change in time; but when we are multiplying the base by the height of the graph, we are actually multiplying the velocity by the time. So let’s look at the time from 3 seconds to 6 seconds. From second 3 to second 4, we are moving at 40 m/s, and we’ve moved for 1 second, so we should have moved exactly 40 m. From second 4 to second 5, we’re still moving at 40 m/s, so to find the total distance in those two seconds, we simply add them together. Do this a third time, and you can simply multiply 3 by 40 to find our result.

msgid "Like the decay constant, the half-life tells us everything we need to know to guess what kind of isotope we might have. It even turns out that the two numbers are equivalent if you correctly solve the radioactive decay equation. This means that, like the decay constant, the half-life gives an estimate of the stability of a particular radioactive substance, and it can thus be used to identify unknown isotopes. The primary reason that scientists use half-lives instead of decay constants is because half-lives have a more intuitive immediate meaning: if a scientist collects 20 kg of a radioactive isotope with a half-life of 30 min, and she leaves her lab to meet with a grad student for 30 minutes, when she comes back she will have 10 kg of the isotope remaining. If she then goes to check on another experiment for 30 minutes, when she gets back she will have 5 kg remaining… in other words, for every 30 minutes that passes, she’ll lose half of her sample!"

msgid "Most living things contain carbon-14, an unstable isotope of carbon that has a half-life of around 5,000 years. That means that when scientists dig up fossil bones, they can figure out how old they are by measuring the amount of carbon-14 remaining in the bones. For example, if a fossil bone has half as many of carbon-14 nuclei as a new, non-fossilized bone, then scientists can guess that the fossil is roughly 5,000 years old. This technique of **carbon dating** has been used to estimate the ages of fossils from many different periods in Earth’s history, and at its core it simply relies on scientists drawing decay graphs and counting the number of half-lives that have passed. Carbon dating was recently used to study one of the oldest human-like fossils ever found, and it determined that it was nearly 100,000 years old!"

msgid "Semilog plots are pretty tricky because the vertical axis has funny spacing. In the plot above, 100 appears to come halfway between 10 and 1000. This is because when we take logarithms of these numbers we get log(1000)=6.9, log(100)=4.6, log(10)=2.3, which are evenly spaced. So when we read the slope on a semilog plot, we need to remember to always take the logarithm of whatever values we read off the vertical axis. The slope of the line on the semilog plot corresponds to the same decay constant k, that we can identify in a normal exponential decay plot."

Because this particle’s interactions with other tissues are easily identifiable, some medical imaging techniques involve purposefully injecting a patient with an element that beta decays into positrons, and then monitoring where the positrons are emitted.

msgid "But for something as simple as a flashlight, the electrons don’t actually need to move that fast to carry enough energy to light up the bulb. When you turn on a flashlight, it can take the electrons in the switch **up to a full minute** to travel through the light bulb! The reason that the light comes on instantly is because there are already many free electrons in the bulb’s filament (as well as all of the other parts of the circuit), and so there’s a net current from electrons moving throughout the entire circuit even though the electrons at any given location are slowpokes. When you switch your flashlight on, an electric field appears almost instantaneously in all parts of the circuit, but it actually pushes individual electrons along pretty slowly. The reason that the slow-moving electrons are able to get any work done at all is because there’s just so many of them!"

msgid "Remembering our water analogy, AC circuits move energy around in the same way that ripples in water carry energy. When you throw a rock into a pond, the ensuing ripples are able to travel throughout the pond cause leaves and other floating debris to oscillate on the water’s surface. This means that energy has been transferred from the rock to the floating leaves, even though no single water molecule has actually travelled all the way from the rock’s impact point to the floating debris. The energy is carried by the waves formed on the water’s surface, in which chains of water molecules push and pull on each other in succession, transferring energy without actually moving anyone around."

msgid "Slow-moving charges are the reason that you don’t have superpowers. Your nerves act as electric circuits that carry messages from your brain to your muscles, but these circuits use salty water instead of metal wires to conduct electrical current. Because direct current moves pretty slowly (especially in salt water!), most of the information is carried in the form of alternating current. Electrical signals cause various ions dissolved in the salt water to rapidly migrate into different parts of each nerve cell, which in turn creates new electric fields that move around the ions in the next nerve cell down the line. But the actual ions and electrons conducting this current mostly stay near their particular nerve cell, and so the signals carried by the nervous system look a lot like the waves in alternating current circuits. The biggest limitation in how fast electrical signals can travel through the nervous system involves the relatively slow rate at which charged ions and electrons can migrate back to their original positions in the cell---were it not for this physical limitation, your nerves could fire arbitrarily quickly and you’d have super-fast reflexes!"

msgid "So you can visualize an AC circuit as a bunch of electrons spaced evenly apart, where the guys in the back periodically shove the guys in front of them, creating ripples that travel through the entire line until reaching the device that is connected to the power source. AC circuits use these ripples to transfer electrical energy and do work without actually requiring the electrons to travel very far. This makes AC circuits a very simple example of how **waves can be used to carry energy**."

msgid "The mechanism for this is pretty clever: when an AC circuit is activated, the power source starts shoving on electrons at one end of a wire. This shoving is periodic: the closest electron to the source gets pushed forward a tiny amount, but then it gets pulled back. Overall, the electron doesn’t go anywhere. But remember that electrons *can’t stand* to get too close to each other---as soon as the electron in the back of the line gets pushed forward by the power source, the electron right in front of him in the line gets pushed forward a little bit, too. There’s also a nearly negligible time delay between when the guy in the back moves forward and the guy in front of front of him moves forward. This delayed secondary “push” in turn causes the second-to-last guy to shove the third-to-last guy forward a little bit, and so on and so on throughout the entire wire. When the power source pulls the backmost electron back to his original position, the guy in front of him is then able to scoot back a little bit as well, and so on and so forth until the electrons throughout the wire are back in their original spots."

Yet a tremendous wave like a tsunami is capable of sinking ships and destroying docks purely due the combined force exerted by the tremendous mass of water that it carries. Electric circuits are very much the same way---the individual electrons travel remarkable slowly through the circuit, yet there are so many of them that they can do all sorts of useful things."

msgid "Electron configurations are a simple way of writing down the locations of all of the electrons in an atom. As we know, the positively-charged protons in the nucleus of an atom tend to attract negatively-charged electrons. While these electrons all stick within the atom because of their attraction to the protons, they also mutually repel each other, causing them to spread out around the nucleus in regular patterns. This results in beautiful geometric structures called **orbitals** that represent the distinct regions around the nucleus that each electron traces out. The reason that electrons tend to stay in their separate orbitals rather than piling on top of one another is the **Pauli Exclusion Principle**, a theorem from quantum mechanics that dictates that no two electrons can ever be in the same place. The Pauli Exclusion Principle arises from more than just the electrostatic repulsion of negative electrons: it comes from fundamental physical principles that constrain all subatomic particles."

msgid "The orbitals represent **identifiable “addresses”** for each electron around an atom. Think of the electrons as being tenants in one of several blocks of studio apartments located near a nice park. The electrons all want to live near the park (nucleus), but they can’t all live in the same place. Instead, some electrons get to live in the apartments closest to the nucleus, but as the number of electrons that want to live near a given nucleus increases, the further out some of them need to move since apartments closer to the nucleus fill up. This describes a trend observed in the periodic table: elements with small atomic number (and thus fewer electrons) tend to have most of their electrons living in orbitals near the nucleus. As we move further down the periodic table, orbitals and energy levels further out from the nucleus begin to fill up with electrons."

The reason that the first two rows have fewer columns involves crowding effects due to the proximity of the electrons to the nucleus. Once you’ve remembered and drawn the table, just follow the arrow (starting from the top) until the subscripts add up to the total number of electrons in your atom. So if you wanted to write down the electron configuration for beryllium (4 electrons), you’d start at the top and pass through 1s, and then you’d loop around until you reached 2s. The sum of the subscripts of the bubbles you’ve passed through is now 4, and so you’re done. Your path spells out the correct configuration for beryllium:"

The decrease in pressure occurs simply because as you go higher there is less air above you pushing down on you."

msgid "The amount of dissolved gases in your bloodstream is related to the pressure that you’re sitting at. That means that when you scuba dive with a pressurized air tank, the amount of dissolved nitrogen in your bloodstream actually increases as you get deeper. If, at the end of a dive, you attempt to re-surface very quickly, this dissolved nitrogen will suddenly exit your bloodstream in the form of tiny bubbles that can disrupt or damage your blood vessels. This condition is known as *decompression sickness* or *the bends*, and it constitutes a life-threatening risk in deep-sea divers. The primary means by which divers can avoid developing the bends is by carefully controlling their rates of re-ascent during a very long dive. The reason that this condition is less of a risk for submarine-divers is because submarines have thick walls that hold out the external pressure, keeping the internal pressure pretty much constant."

msgid "This says that the buoyant force F$\\text{}_{b}$ acting on the sub is determined by the density of water (d$\\text{}_{water}$, which is roughly 1 g/cm$^\\text{3}$), the volume of the submarine (V$\\text{}_{sub}$), and gravity (g). You might be surprised to see that “g” appears in the equation for buoyant force, which always points in the *opposite direction* to the weight of an object due to gravity. But there’s a good reason for this: the buoyant force on an object equals the total weight of water that it pushes out of the way. For bigger subs (larger V$\\text{}_{sub}$), more water needs to get pushed out of the way, and so the buoyant force is larger."

msgid "Under *water* is a different situation. Because water is very dense, pressure rapidly increases with depth in the ocean. For every ten meters deeper you dive, the pressure of the surrounding water increases by an amount that’s equal to the total ambient pressure that you feel when you’re at the surface (101 kPa). So if you dive down to 10 m, the total pressure your body feels is now 202 kPa. If you dive even deeper to 20 m, you’ll feel 303 kPa! It’s important to remember that this pressure arises purely due to the combined weight of all the water that’s sitting above you. If you were diving on a planet with less gravity than Earth, the pressure you feel at 10 meters would be less than 202 kPa."

msgid "You don your itchiest wetsuit and climb aboard his submarine, which has suspiciously thick iron walls given how tiny and cramped it is inside. Jacques reminds you that the super-thick walls are necessary in order to survive the descent to the bottom of the Trench, since the external pressure down there is nearly 1000 times what you’re used to at sea level. The stiff walls hold the pressure inside constant even while the pressure outside increases. The walls themselves actually get compressed due to the gradually-increasing *difference* in pressure across them. The reason that they don’t collapse onto you and Jacques is that they compress (like springs), which counter balances the force arising from the pressure difference. So as the submarine dives deeper, the internal pressure (thankfully) stays the same… but the walls actually get thinner!"

msgid "where g is the acceleration due to gravity, 9.8 m/s/s. But you know that gravity isn’t the only force that acts on the submarine. There must be a buoyant force that acts to counteract it. The submarine is filled with air (like a balloon), so you expect it would float on top of the water were it not for the action of its propeller: even though the steel walls of the submarine make it heavy, this added weight is offset by a huge amount of trapped air. This effect is similar to a balloon, which doesn’t float until it’s filled with air. The submarine thus requires a propeller that acts together with gravity to make the submarine sink, despite the buoyant force acting on it."

That means that if we choose a spot on the wall, two light waves will be hitting it; one from the top slit and one from the bottom slit. As they get close to the wall, and close to one another, they will start to interfere. We know that the two waves were exactly the same when they got to the card, but they won’t necessarily be the same when they reach the wall.

If we choose a different point on the wall, then we’ll get a different number of wavelengths again for each path that the light takes from its slit to the wall. The key is to compare the number of wavelengths it takes for each light wave to travel from the slit to the wall. For constructive interference, the difference in wavelengths will be an integer number of whole wavelengths.

If instead we realize that there are a few light waves travelling through each of the two slits at once, then we can see that there will be a diffraction pattern for each individual slit (in addition to the two-slit interference pattern). Since the two slits are close together, and their diffraction patterns are wide, their individual diffraction patterns are similar and we can combine the two diffraction patterns to get the same “single-slit” diffraction pattern that we got for one slit. This pattern will hold our double-slit interference pattern back, limiting how bright the bright spots can be at any given point on the wall."

For this reason, one configuration of the device consists of a giant electromagnet coil that surrounds the patient’s body. As we’ve learned from the right-hand rule, the current that travels in a spiral around the patient generates a magnetic field that points in a straight line along the patient’s body."

An MRI is just a device that first excites water molecules into releasing waves, and then records the locations of those waves with high accuracy."

msgid "But while this really strong constant magnetic field makes all the protons want to line up, the MRI machine intentionally disrupts this field by sending a brief pulse of an additional, weaker electromagnetic field. This weaker pulse points in a different direction than the constant magnetic field, and so it disrupts the protons so that they become misaligned with the constant field. After the pulse ends the protons are left askew, but then they gradually re-align with the original constant field. You can think of it as the tiny jiggle that occurs in a compass needle when a weak magnet passes by. The compass normally points north, but the weak magnet causes the compass needle to jiggle slightly. "

Because the water molecules in the body are warm, they are constantly jiggling around and colliding with one another.

msgid "However, unlike the needle of a normal-sized compass, the direction that the protons can align has single, well defined levels in a manner very similar to the different energy levels of electrons around an atom’s nucleus. Just as electrons in atomic energy levels can absorb and re-emit photons when changing energy levels, the gradual realignment of the nuclear magnetic spin results in the emission of low-energy, radio frequency photons. The time and amount of re-alignment changes based on the thickness and hardness of the tissue where the water molecules are sitting, and so carefully monitoring of the arrival of re-emitted photons in the MRI’s detectors allows the locations and shapes of different tissues to be identified."

msgid "NMR spectroscopy was originally developed to help chemists who had created strange compounds that they couldn’t identify. In the technique (and just as in MRI), an unknown sample is placed in a static magnetic field, briefly excited with radio-frequency photons (light), and then allowed to re-emit those photons. NMR works because the characteristic frequency of the re-emitted photons varies very slightly based on the structure of the molecule. A proton all by itself may absorb and reemit 900 MHz photons, but when it gets near other charges (such as in a large hydrocarbon chain), the magnetic field around it is gets twisted and distorted and so its resonant frequency may shift to something like 906 MHz. This means that NMR may be used to generate “spectra” corresponding to the amount of resonance at various frequencies, which in turn reveals details of the structure of molecules. So if a chemist looks at the NMR spectrum of her unknown sample and sees a huge peak near 906 MHz, then she knows that her sample probably has at least one hydrocarbon chain somewhere on it."

msgid "Some bodily processes actually change tissues in ways that are noticeable on an MRI. For example, when tissues stretch or swell, the distribution of protons in that part of the body can change enough that a detectable change will occur in the MRI signal coming from that part of the body. This means that MRIs can be used to create movies that reveal details of events over time in a patient’s body. The simplest case involves imaging moving structures like the heart or lungs, which can help pinpoint abnormal valves or blood vessels that wouldn’t stand out in a still image. In a recently-developed fMRI, information about the changing distribution of oxygen in the brain is generated based on the unique magnetic properties of blood containing oxygen versus blood without oxygen. In oxygenated blood, the electrons from the oxygen molecules tend to block applied magnetic fields, effectively screening the hydrogens in water molecules from the applied magnetic field and decreasing the rapidness with which they will align with it. Deoxygenated blood does not have this screening effect, and so the protons align much faster---leading to more radio-frequency photons visible to the MRI detector. Because the changing distribution of oxygenated blood in the brain is known to correlate with neural activity, fMRI can be used to image the parts of a patient’s brain that become active and inactive during various tasks. This makes fMRI a very useful tool for neuroscientists and psychologists."

msgid "Sometimes there is not enough difference in structure between two tissues to see them using MRI. For example, a healthcare provider may want to check out an unusual blood vessel (such as a blood vessel with a blood clot), but such an image may be difficult to see because the neighboring fat and muscle tissue re-emit photons at a similar rate as the blood vessel. There just isn’t enough contrast between the different structures. To solve this problem, the healthcare provider may inject a **contrast agent**, such as Gadolinium (III), into the patient’s bloodstream. Atoms of Gd(III) have really unusual electrical properties that cause them to disrupt the effective magnetic field experienced by protons in the bloodstream, which in turn changes the amount of photons that the protons will absorb and emit. This causes the blood vessels to stand out from neighboring tissues in subsequent MRI images."

Just like the “north” and “south” poles of a needle on a compass tend to align with the magnetic poles of the earth, in the presence of strong magnetic fields each proton in water twists its orientation so that it aligns with the field. When health care providers first turn on the MRI machine, a very strong, constant magnetic field forms that remains in place for the duration of the measurement, and this super-strong field makes all the protons try to line up with the poles of the field. This lining-up doesn’t mess up any of the chemical properties of the tissues, so your body continues to function normally while the doctor makes the measurement."

msgid "For the waves to keep moving back and forth, something needs to push them. In the case of the flute, the person blowing across one end of it pushes the first bit of air, which then pushes the next bit, and so on. The person blowing is providing an area of constant pressure. That means that the particles there don’t get squished together and pulled apart, they move back and forth as a group. The particles on either side of that group do get squished together and pulled apart, as the constant pressure particles move back and forth, but they don’t move back and forth at all. The two kinds of groups of particles alternate all the way down the tube of the flute, so we have some particles that move back and forth, and some particles that squish together and pull apart. Of course, the two groups do have some stragglers in between them that don’t quite know what to do, so they do a bit of both."

msgid "It’s also important to remember that the particles are moving in the same direction as the wave is moving. If you drop a marble into a bucket of water, you will be able to see the ripples that are produced making humps and dips in the water. This is because the water particles are moving up and down while the wave travels outward from the spot where the marble hit. In sound waves, the particles move in the same direction as the wave is moving, so you wouldn’t be able to see them like ripples in the air, instead they make areas in the air where the particles are more squished together, and areas where the particles are further apart."

msgid "In our day to day life, it’s a child’s play for us to ‘count’ things or ‘weigh’ things. For example, you can easily count and tell me that there are 4 bananas or there are 6 apples kept on the table. Shopkeepers can easily weigh things on a weighing balance and tell us ‘this packet of rice weighs 2 pounds’ or ‘this packet of tea weighs 500 g’. But things change when you start dealing with atoms and molecules. You cannot simply count or weigh atoms or molecules, as you can do with the common items that you encounter in your daily life. Here it gets a little tricky and something termed as ‘Stoichiometry’ kicks in."

But the goalie net may be moving so fast that you are not able to stay still on the ice, and you move backwards. Your force is in the opposite direction as the movement. This is the opposite situation from the one above: the moving goalie net has kinetic energy, but loses kinetic energy as you slow it down. In this case, work is negative as the force applied to the goalie net is in the opposite direction of the net’s movement. "

Initially the nets are standing still with zero velocity at the edge of the ice hockey rink. When you push a net, it will start moving at some speed; it has velocity. If there is a velocity then the net now has kinetic energy. Because the direction of the push and the movement of the net are in the same direction, there is now positive energy: the goalie net went from zero energy to some amount of positive kinetic energy. This is an example of positive work."

msgid "Although no physical “language organ” exists in the brain, language acquisition can be hampered if certain parts of the brain are damaged during critical periods of language development. Damage to the left hemisphere, for example can lead to *aphasia* - a disorder which causes problems with language, while leaving intelligence untouched. For example, in Wernicke’s aphasia, patients with damage in a certain region of the brain can no longer understand language. Although they can still form normal sentences, neither what they say nor the words of others make any sense to them. Patients with Broca’s aphasia on the other hand, have problems forming language but no trouble understanding what is said to them. Studies have shown that young children with damage in similar regions of the brain can actually grow up with only slightly impaired language ability - implying that the brain can develop new language pathways that are good, but not quite as good as the original (Reilly, 1998)."

msgid "Another way to look at language learning is to treat it like learning a new skill. The **learning theory** of language acquisition suggests that children learn a language much like they learn to tie their shoes or how to count; through repetition and reinforcement. When babies first learn to babble, parents and guardians smile, coo, and hug them for this behavior. As they grow older, children are praised for speaking properly and corrected when they misspeak. Thus, language arises from stimuli and stimuli response. While this is logical, it fails to explain how new words or phrases come about, since children are only parroting the things they have heard from others."

It’s not a chemical we can test for or a distance we can measure  (imagine  asking a 2 year old how many words they know — not a particularly useful or productive task, right? ). However, there are some facts that are generally agreed upon by the scientific community. The first couple years of life are the critical period for language learning, which becomes a much harder task as people age. Children usually say their first words around 10-18 months of age, and graduate to phrases sometime before they are two years old. In fact, studies have shown that 18 month olds can tell the difference between correctly formed verb pairs (is jumping) and incorrect ones (will jumping). Somewhere between four and seven years old children begin to be able to tell stories that more or less make sense.   "

msgid "Many of these theories initially came about as a result of what is called “armchair psychology”; that is, sitting and thinking about a problem. It is extremely difficult to collect objective and accurate data on what’s going on in the brain in terms of its direct relationship to a behavior such as language. That said, some computational models of language acquisition have been gaining traction in the past several decades. A computational model is a mathematical way to recreate complicated systems we see everyday; from how water flows in a river, to how children learn languages. The model is built to represent the way we think something happens. For example, in the model of the learning theory approach, a word would be learned faster if it came up a lot or the subject received a lot of input about it. Then, linguists change how different variables work to see what affect that would have on the system. If the model behaves and “learns” the same way that we do, it’s a good sign that the model is on the right track. These models have helped to identify and measure linguistical features such as the critical period for language learning, the vocabulary burst, and the U-shaped learning mentioned earlier."

The majority of world languages have verbs and nouns, although this is not true in every instance, as well as  similar ways to structure thoughts. Language is thought of as having a finite amount of rules from which we can build an infinite amount of phrases, and the core of these rules is somehow programmed into our brains.

msgid "The **interactionist approach** (sociocultural theory) combines ideas from sociology and biology to explain how language is developed. According to this theory, children learn language out of a desire to communicate with the world around them. Language emerges from, and is dependent upon, social interaction. The Interactionist approach claims that if our language ability develops out of a desire to communicate, then language is dependent upon whom we want to communicate with. This means the environment you grow up in will heavily affect how well and how quickly you learn to talk. For example, infants being raised by only their mother are more likely to learn the word “mama”, and less likely to develop “dada”.  Among the first words we learn are ways to demand attention or food. If you’ve ever tried to learn a new language, you may recognize this theory’s influence. Language classes often teach commonly used vocabulary and phrases first, and then focus on building conversations rather than simple rote memorization. Even when we expand our vocabularies in our native language, we remember the words we use the most. \t"

msgid "We also know that learning a language is not like walking up the steady increase of a ramp, but more like walking the hills and valleys of a country road. Usually when we learn a new skill, the more we practice the better we get. However, this isn’t always true in the early stages of language development. When children are first learning to talk, the verbs they use are usually the most common such as go, eat, talk, give, run, etc. These are often irregular in the past tense. Although at first they use the past tense properly (“I ran”, “he went”, etc), kids typically regress for a while. They often over-follow rules, saying phrases like “I runned” instead of “I ran”. As their vocabularies expand rapidly (known as vocabulary burst), some researchers believe children notice patterns in language, and that leads to over-correction as described in the example above. Eventually, children begin to understand where the rules apply and where they don’t, and then properly form the past tense once more. This is known as a *U shaped learning curve*, because the language mastery started high, dropped for a period of time, and then improved again.  Thus, there appears to be a mimicking (copying) phase first and then a time of broad generalizations before children settle into language."

Linguistic relativism means that there are certain thoughts we have in one language (e.g. English) that cannot be understood by those who exist in another language context (e.g. Spanish). The way we think is also strongly affected by our native languages. For example, the Inuits (northern aboriginals) have dozens of ways to convey the word snow. In English, how many ways can you think of to express snow?  Maybe four or five ways? Snow, flurry, sleet,...?"

msgid "In addition, culture can also demonstrate the way a group thinks, their practices, or behavioral patterns, or their views of the world. For example, in some countries like China, it is acceptable to stare at others in public, or to stand very close to others in public spaces. In South Africa, if you board a nearly empty bus or enter a nearly empty movie theater, it is regarded as polite to sit next to the only person there. On the other hand, in a recent study of Greyhound bus trips in the US, a researcher found that the greatest unspoken rule of bus-taking is that if other seats are available, one should never sit next to another person. Numerous passengers expressed that “it makes you look weird”. These are all examples of cultural norms that people in one society may be used to. Norms that you are used to are neither right nor wrong, just different. Picture walking into a nearly empty movie theater when visiting another country, and not sitting next to the only person in the theater. Another person walks up and tells you off for being rude. You, not used to these norms, feel confused, and anxious. This disorientation you feel is an example of culture shock."

msgid "In the 1930s, two anthropologists Edward Sapir and Benjamin Lee Whorf, noticed that the Hopi Indians in the United States had no words to differentiate between the past, present, and future. This was a surprising discovery. In English, we can easily think of tense and know what time frame someone is referring to. The two scholars found that the way language is used affected the way we think about and perceive the world. In other words, worldviews and cultural influences are largely embedded within the language we use, even if we are saying things like coffee. When we talk about coffee in the US, we would think of a large mug, and the coffee would come from a pot of coffee. When Europeans talk about coffee, they are most likely thinking about little espresso cups filled with strong coffee."

msgid "Is ethnocentrism bad or good? On the one hand, ethnocentrism can lead to negative judgments of the behaviors of groups or societies. It can also lead to discrimination against people who are different. For example, in many countries, religious minorities (religions that are not the dominant religion) often face discrimination. But on the other hand, ethnocentrism can create loyalty among the same social group or people in the same society. For example, during the World Cup or Olympics, you may tend to root for your own country and believe that the players or teams representing your country are much better. National pride is also part of ethnocentrism. "

The main character walks into the high school cafeteria, and sees the students sitting in a particular arrangement: the jocks, the mean girls, the nerds, the band geeks, the stoners, the goths. If you went to an American high school, you may immediately understand what the groupings mean. However, even among those of you that did go to an American high school, the definition of *mean girls* may be completely different. Now think, on the other side of the world, a high school student watching this movie in China would be very confused. If you try to explain these groupings to someone outside the linguistic cultural context, it becomes very difficult. Why are people in bands geeks? What is a stoner, can someone be both a nerd and a stoner at the same time? "

However, for those who are well-versed in Chinese or Ayurvedic medicine will likely understand that *warm* foods would be good for the sniffles or even rheumatoid arthritis, while *chilly* foods would be good for constipation or mouth ulcers.

msgid "Some people worry that the concept of culture can also be abused and misinterpreted. If one culture behaves one way, does that mean all cultures can behave that way as well? For example, many countries and international organizations oppose the act of whaling (the fishing of whales) for environmental reasons. These environmental organizations say that there are not many whales left and such fishing practices should be stopped. However, other countries argue that whaling is a cultural practice that has been around for thousands of years. Because it may be part of a country’s oceanic culture, this country may say that such a cultural  practice should not be opposed based on cultural differences, say, by an inland country that does not understand. Who gets to define what a moral cultural behavior is? Is whaling immoral? Two different cultures may have very different answers, as we saw in the above example. Another more extreme instance would be female genital cutting in some parts of the world. Locally, it is argued that the practice has cultural roots, but such a practice has raised concerns among many international human rights organizations."

msgid "Another interesting city growth phenomenon in the US is *suburbanization*. In countries such as China, the term *‘suburbs’* is not a familiar one. This may have to do with its relatively late urbanization in the late 1980s. In the US, when inner cities become too crowded, residents started migrating to the suburbs, which are communities that are adjacent to but outside of the city. This is also called *urban sprawl* or *suburban sprawl*, which describes how people move from central urban areas to low-density areas outside of the city. Suburban communities are mostly car-dependent. Some large cities are so ‘sprawled’ out that they are almost connected to other cities that used to seem further away. Below we can see a NASA photo that shows the metropolitan areas of the Northeast. This demonstrates the urban sprawl, with the lights illustrating cities and their sprawling suburbs."

msgid "As cities expand, what happens in areas in between cities? *Edge cities* have appeared. When you are driving down the highway, you see houses, stores, and hotels located near major highway intersections. Those clusters are edge cities. Often they do not have their own mayors and belong to a bigger city or town. What about within cities, how cities change internally? One prominent phenomenon is *gentrification*. This is an interesting urban development pattern in the US. The middleclass move into a more under-maintained area of a city due to the increase in the number of residents and surge in rent or housing prices in expensive city centers. In doing so, the poor who primarily lived in the under-maintained areas are displaced as the middleclass drive up rent prices and buy up property. You can see this phenomenon in San Francisco and surrounding areas such as Oakland. As housing prices in San Francisco increases, middleclass residents move outwards to Oakland across the bay. As Oakland prices also increase, people look again to move outwards, further expanding into other small cities nearby. Harlem in New York City is another example. The “unsafe” image of Harlem 10 years ago is a very different one from the Harlem today full of amenities—shops, restaurants, and other services."

msgid "As more cities formed, an increasing proportion of the population moved into the cities. This is called *urbanization*. According to statistics, in 1800, only 3% of the world’s population lived in cities. A tipping point was reached in 2008, and there were officially more people living in cities than rural areas. Urbanization has been occurring especially rapidly in less developed parts of the world. As cities and their infrastructure become more mature in developing countries, more people move into the cities from rural areas. Why would people want to move to a city? First of all, people have become less attached to land as a means of production. This means that people aren’t necessarily farmers anymore, and their jobs are not associated with farming. Therefore, moving into a city would be better for them, since cities offer a wide variety of jobs. Second of all, cities, because of the division of labor, offer all types of products and services for their residents. Thirdly, with the development of schools, people are becoming more educated or at least have better access to education. Therefore, *human capital* has become more important—things such as knowledge and creativity, instead of labor capital, which is based on a person being able to make money in exchange for their labor."

msgid "Below are three models of urban growth developed by urban sociologists in the US. In general, a city grows from the center, then outwards. In the *concentric zone model*, Zone 1 is the central business district (CBD). Zone 2 is a transitional area containing rooming houses and deteriorating housing which breed poverty, disease, and vice. Zone 3 is the area thrifty workers have moved in order to escape the transitional Zone 2 yet maintain convenient access to their work. Zone 4 contains more expensive apartments, hotels, single-family home, etc. Commuters live in Zone 10 which consists of suburbs or satellite cities that have popped up around transportation routes. Have you ever been to Chicago? This is similar to the early city setup of Chicago, and most other traditional US cities with clear central business districts. But as transportation became more developed, ‘zones’ have also become less obvious. For example, Los Angeles is an example of a city without clear ‘zones’ since it is so spread out."

msgid "Cities have been around for thousands of years. Have you thought about how cities were formed? After the *Neolithic Revolution*, people shifted from a nomadic lifestyle of hunting and gathering to a lifestyle of farming and settlement. Oftentimes, people gathered around water sources, such as rivers and lakes, and built non-nomadic or permanent settlements. Gradually, these settlements expanded, and small cities formed. Densely populated settlements emerged, along with the specialization and division of labor among people living in the city. Trade, bartering, or other forms of economic exchange also took place. Architecture, centralized administrations, and political structures also all became part of a city. A city is complex and encompasses all these different meanings. Two hundred years ago, the only city that had more than one million people was Beijing, China. But today, there are more than 500 cities with over a million people. This was due to the Industrial Revolution, which contributed to the development of faster means of transportation and communication methods. This ability for people, resources, and information to move around rapidly allows cities to exist."

msgid "However, some people who study urbanization argue that a city is a *growth machine* rather than the outcomes of a natural process, unlike what urban ecologists argue. For them, urban growth is not just organized by spatial geography, and cities will not just reorganize itself after periods of disorganization. The growth machine theory points out that urban growth is driven by a coalition of interest groups who all benefit from a city’s continuous growth and expansion. For them, the growth of cities is social, political, and largely planned and intended. For example, real estate interests may be involved—when urban growth happens, some groups benefit because properties increase in value. How groups lobby or manipulate the government or other groups, determine how cities grow and take shape. How people within the city are distributed is not so much related to geography, transportation, or space, but rather to the social actions of interest groups."

"In a *multiple nuclei model*, a city may have several centers of ‘nuclei’. The model says that even if a city did begin with one CBD, it can still develop multiple smaller business districts. This model is applicable to a lot of large cities today. For example, Mumbai and Shanghai are both examples of multiple nuclei cities. Each nucleus in these cities contains a specialized activity—such as clusters of fast-food restaurants or retail districts. Areas with similar activities cluster together to draw consumers, or because land-use is similar in adjacent areas.\n"

Lower-income housing can be found along railroads or bordering manufacturing and industrial sectors. Chicago today is closer to this model than the original concentric zone model.

msgid "We’ve talked about cities and urban growth, but what happens within a city? People who study how residents in the cities adapt to their environments are called *urban ecologists*. They are very much like ecology biologists who study the relationship between animal behaviors in connection with their environment. Urban ecologists focus on the social and spatial context—how industries are distributed within the city or how the city is spatially organized, and how this relates to city residents. Like ecologists, urban ecologists think that cities form as a result of *natural growth*. This natural growth refers to urban expansion, immigration, and succession (new people moving in and replacing those that move out), and this is very much related to geography and the natural environment of a city. Cities may become disorganized when newcomers or immigrants move in, but it will gradually become organized again after a period of time. During these transitional changing periods, the city may suffer from more crime and other social problems in areas with the most movement of incoming and outgoing people."

msgid "A second type of social group is a *secondary group*. Secondary groups are larger, more anonymous, and impersonal compared to primary groups. They also tend to be more short-term. Such groups are often based on shared interests, hobbies, or activities. For example, forming a temporary task group to plan a holiday party at work or organizing a reading group before an exam. Oftentimes, secondary group members interact based on social statuses. If you’re a worker you may belong to a union; if you’re a student, you may be in a college class with a lot of other students; if you’re a professor, you may belong to a professional association. As you interact more with people in your larger secondary group, these groups may break down into primary groups. Stronger friendships may form between you and a few others in the class of 150 students in Statistics 101, and you then become close long-term friends who influence one another. This is an example of how secondary groups may break down into primary groups."

msgid "If there are so many social groups around you, think about what groups you identify with and what groups you do not feel attached to. For example, if you do not like sports, you may find that hanging out with a group of basketball fans to be very meaningless. On the other hand, if you like dogs, you may find out that hanging out with other dog-owners feels significant to you. In other words, you would identify as being a member of the dog-owner group, but you would not feel like you are a part of the basketball group. When you identify yourself as a member of a particular social group, that group would be an *in-group* for you. When you do not identify with that group, it would in contrast be an *out-group* for you."

msgid "Look at the next diagram. Sometimes you will see such visual representations when trying to differentiate between social ties. For example, the node with the X on it represents you. The Y node represents a family member, say, your mother. The Z node represents a classmate. You can see that the distance from node X to node Y is shorter than from node X to node Z. You and your mother represent a *close* social tie, while you and your classmate represent a farther social tie. You can also see that the line between X and Y is thicker than the line between X and Z. This shows that the *strength* of the social tie between you and your mother is stronger than between you and your classmate. This is of course a very simplified example of a social network! Can you imagine how your Facebook social network diagram would look like with more than 1,000 friends?"

msgid "Oftentimes by choice, people choose relationships with other people who have similar characteristics with them. This tendency is referred to as *homophily*. Homophily means *love of the same*, or simply *birds of a feather flock together!* Homophily is present in many social network study findings. In a social network, homophily means that individuals with similar traits are more likely to form social ties with one another, which also often impacts their actions. Similarities breed connections! For example, networks studies have found that if people in your immediate social network make unhealthy food choices, you are also much more likely to make unhealthy choices! Particularly, spouses have a very significant effect on your food selection, and of all foods, you’re most likely to share snacks and alcohol consumption patterns with your peers!"

msgid "Since you identify more with your in-group, there is something called *in-group favoritism*, where you may give preferential treatment to those you perceive are part of your in-group. Studies have shown that in-group favoritism occur even in in-groups that are assigned arbitrarily. In other words, you would show preference for your in-group even if you do not have strong non-arbitrary characteristics such as ethnicity, religion, or even gender. For example, in an experiment, researchers had 10 random participants do a coin toss. Those who chose heads were placed with other participants that also chose heads as a result. The other group consisted of the participants who chose tails as a result. These participants did not know each other before the experiment, and their grouping (heads or tails) was meaningless. Each participant were then asked to distribute money between the 9 other participants who are only identified by their group membership (Group Heads or Group Tails). Participants are told that after the money distribution, they would receive the total amount of money given to them by other participants. Surprisingly, the researchers found that participants, without knowing anyone personally in their same group, almost always had a tendency to give more money to in-group members than to out-group members! In short, the study shows that sometimes it takes you very little to identify yourself with a group (your in-group) and be biased against an out-group."

As a person, you may belong to many different types of groups: a religious group, an ethnic group, your workplace colleague group, your college class, a sports team, etc. These groups can also be called *social groups*. We have something in common with others in the same group, we identify with the group, and the group can create a sense of belonging for us. A group is different from an *aggregate*, where people are temporarily together in a space, maybe even doing the same things, but do not identify themselves as belonging together. For example, being in a crowded supermarket or standing in line at the movie theater does not make you feel like you belong with the people doing the same thing as you. A group is also different from a *category*. If you are in the same category as a person, you may share similar characteristics—like age, height, or you both wear glasses, but you may not interact or feel the sense of belonging."

In the first part of your life, you are likely influenced fundamentally by *primary groups*. Your family and friends are in this group. Your family shaped your basic values in life. You feel a sense of belonging to your family. As you grow, you feel a sense of belonging expanding to friends. Primary groups give you an identity and a strong *sense of self* (a feeling of who you are) by providing more intimate and direct face-to-face interactions. They are *primary* because they are very important in shaping who you are as a person. They also tend to be close-knit groups that are mostly small and intimate, and normally long-lasting, such as family and friends."
