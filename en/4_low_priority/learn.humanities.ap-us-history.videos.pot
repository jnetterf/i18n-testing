msgid "The Cold War was a period of increased tensions and competition for global influence between the United States that lasted from approximately 1945 until 1991. Tensions increased in the aftermath of World War II when the United States dropped the atom bomb and Russian forces took over Eastern Europe. During the Cold War, the United States and the Soviet Union never directly attacked one another, but instead fought proxy wars in order to repel or spread communism, respectively."

msgid "In the Constitutional Convention of 1787, the delegates compromised on state representation by dividing the legislative branch between the Senate, in which every state has two representatives regardless of size, and the House of Representations, where representatives are apportioned to the states according to their population. For the purposes of apportionment, the delegates agreed to the now-infamous Three-Fifths Compromise, which counted each enslaved resident of the Southern states as three-fifths of a person."

Although &quot;men&quot; in this case was intended to represent &quot;all mankind,&quot; at the time of the American Revolution full citizenship was reserved for white men. By saying all men were &quot;created equal&quot; Thomas Jefferson intended to abolish the system of hereditary aristocracy, where some individuals were born as lords and others were ordinary. Over time, the phrase &quot;all men are created equal&quot; has come to be interpreted to mean &quot;all people are created equal,&quot; regardless of race, sex, or class.&nbsp;"
