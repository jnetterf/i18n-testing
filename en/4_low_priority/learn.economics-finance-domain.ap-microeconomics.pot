"This unit builds our understanding of the basic postulates underlying consumer choice:\n"
"utility, the law of diminishing marginal utility and utility-maximizing conditions, and\n"
"their application in consumer decision-making and in explaining the law of demand.\n"
"By examining the demand side of the product market, we learn how incomes,\n"
"prices, and tastes affect consumer purchases. Here it is important that we\n"
"understand how to derive an individualâ€™s demand curve, how individual and market\n"
"demand curves are related, and how the income and substitution effects explain the\n"

"This unit covers production and cost analysis both in the short run and in\n"
"the long run. It begins with an introduction of the short-run production\n"
"function, describing the relationship between the quantity of inputs and the quantity\n"
"of output. Within the context of the production function, we understand\n"
"average and marginal products as well as the law of diminishing marginal returns.\n"
"We learn the link between productivity and costs and examine the relationships\n"
"among the short-run costs: total, average, and marginal. With an introduction of the\n"
"concept of cost minimization and productive efficiency, this unit also includes a\n"
