msgid "This doesn’t mean you should literally pose a question in your essay, but you should certainly keep the reader wondering, “How is that going to turn out?” “What does she mean by that?” “How is this all going to tie back together?” To accomplish that, begin your essay with a hook  that encourages the reader to want to find out more. You might write, for example, “I sat down in the back of the crowded auditorium without a clue that I’d soon be standing center stage.” This establishes a forward momentum right off the bat that makes your reader want to continue reading.

msgid "Go back through your results and identify what type of questions you consistently missed. Was it algebra? Grammar? Sentence structure? Did you miss mostly easy questions because you weren’t paying attention, or were there specific content areas where you struggled? Once you notice patterns of mistakes on a particular type of question or in a particular section of the test, make a plan for what you want to cover. Purchase a book with practice questions and explanations on these topics, or use one of several resources available for free online such as [**Official SAT Practice on Khan Academy**](/mission/sat).  Regardless of which resource you use to study, the most important thing is to be targeted, focusing your energy on specific areas of weakness."

msgid "The good news is that you’ve already begun your preparation! In large part, the SAT and ACT are meant to be tests of what you have learned in high school. The very best way to prepare for these tests, then, is to take challenging classes and work hard to understand the content. So ask those questions in geometry, revise that paper for English one more time, and sign up for that AP History class even if it sounds like a lot of work. Taking your studies seriously, more than any test prep tricks and gimmicks, will ensure that you are primed for success on both the SAT and ACT."
