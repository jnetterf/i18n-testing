msgid "**Biofuels** are fuels derived from living organisms, usually plants. They include products such as ethanol and biodiesel, and food crops are often the source of the sugars, starches or oils used in their production. For example, corn (Zea mays) is a popular feedstock for ethanol production, whereas soy and canola oil may be used to make biodiesel."

msgid "Another underappreciated dimension of the biofuels debate is water use. In this context, “water footprints” are the amounts of water needed to grow enough of a specific crop to produce one liter of ethanol or biodiesel. These footprints range from 1,400 liters of water for ethanol made from sugar beets to 14,000 liters of water for biodiesel made from rapeseed (also known as canola). Of course, some of that water will come from rainfall. Looking at the amount that must come from surface and groundwater, ethanol production from sugar beet again has the smallest footprint, 566 liters of water from irrigation per liter of ethanol produced. Biofuels from sorghum, soybean and rapeseed all require more than 5,000 liters of irrigation water per liter of fuel produced. In many parts of the world, expanding agriculture to produce biofuels . . . will mean more water demand and less water for wildlife. . . ."

msgid "Biofuels are thought to be a “green,” or environmentally friendly alternative to fossil fuels because they are produced from organisms that take-up heat-trapping CO2 from the atmosphere. When the fuels are burned, that same CO2 returns to the atmosphere, ideally causing no or little net increase in atmospheric CO2\\. Indeed, comparisons have found that biofuels produce roughly 20% less greenhouse gas emissions than fossil fuels. However, these calculations failed to consider emissions from changes in land use. As demand and prices for feedstock such as corn have grown, people have increasingly transformed forested and grassland areas to crop production. The harvesting or burning of trees and the plowing of land emit large amounts CO2\\. Factoring in these emissions tips the balance away from [some] biofuels and reveals that production and burning of biofuels can cause more greenhouse gas emissions than fossil fuel use. For example, over 30 years, corn-based ethanol is projected to cause nearly twice the emissions that gasoline would."

msgid "Fortunately, there are alternatives to using the edible portions of food crops as biofuel feedstock, and several of these options look hopeful in terms of their net environmental impacts. Waste products from agriculture, including inedible plant parts such as the leaves and stalks of corn plants, and biomass from nonfood crops such as switchgrass (Panicum virgatum) could be used to produce . . . ethanol. Perennial prairie vegetation could serve as an alternative feedstock for . . . ethanol production, while also providing benefits for wildlife."

msgid "The benefits or costs of biofuels strongly depend on the extent to which the land used to produce [them] would otherwise have functioned as a carbon storehouse. From this perspective, what might seem like an environmentally benign policy to promote production of biofuels could have pernicious effects. For example, the Conservation Reserve Program pays U.S. farmers to convert agricultural land to perennial grasslands to reduce soil erosion and provide habitat for wildlife. However, growing demand for biofuels has caused some agricultural lands that were set aside for conservation purposes to be returned to production. The diversity and abundance of vertebrate species is generally reduced when non-crop habitats are converted to the production of … crops, especially corn."
