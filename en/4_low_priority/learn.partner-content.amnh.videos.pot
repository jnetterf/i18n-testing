msgid "Were dinosaurs already undergoing a long-term decline before an asteroid hit at the end of the Cretaceous about 65.5 million years ago? A study led by Museum scientists gives a multifaceted answer. The findings, published in May, 2012, in the journal <em>Nature</em> Communications, suggest that in general, large-bodied, &ldquo;bulk-feeding&rdquo; herbivores were declining during the last 12 million years of the Cretaceous Period. But carnivorous dinosaurs and mid-sized herbivores were not."

msgid "The extinction of non-avian dinosaurs except birds at the end of the Cretaceous has intrigued paleontologists for more than a century. One theory is that an asteroid impact 65 million years ago off the coast of Mexico generated massive tsunamis, with impact debris cutting off sunlight for months, stopping photosynthesis and causing freezing temperatures. Chemical reactions in the atmosphere caused acid rain and long-term global warming, all of which extinguished non-avian dinosaurs. However, at the same time, massive lava flows erupted across what is now southwest India. The eruptions probably caused many of the same effects as the asteroid impact. Although most scientists believe that the impact was the final blow for non-avian dinosaurs, both events could well have played a role."

msgid "To find fossils, paleontologists first carry out an operation called prospecting, which involves hiking while keeping one&#39;s eyes focused on the ground in hopes of finding fragments of fossils on the surface. Once a fossil fragment is found, the collector brushes away the loose dirt on the surface to see if more of the specimen is buried in the ground. Awls, rock hammers, chisels, and other tools are used to remove the rock covering the bones to see how much of the skeleton is present. Special glue is applied to the cracks and fractures to hold the fossil together. Next, a trench is dug around the bones so that they sit on a low pedestal. A layer of plaster bandages is wrapped around the bones to create a hard cast. Once the cast hardens, the fossil in is packed for shipment back to the museum."

Occasionally, dinosaur fossils are also found in sedimentary rocks representing ancient, desert sand dunes.

Occasionally, when conditions are optimal, soft parts of organisms can also fossilize, such as impressions of skin, body outlines, and, more commonly, leaves. Other traces of objects made by organisms, such as footprints, burrows, and nests, also qualify to be called fossils. Most definitions of fossils require that the organism&#39;s body part or other physical trace be more than 10,000 years old in order to truly be called a fossil."

The hind feet of extinct dinosaurs probably looked like a bird&#39;s foot, but what about the rest of their body? Rare, non-avian dinosaur &quot;mummies&quot; provide intriguing direct evidence. One of these is the AMNH <em>Edmontosaurus</em> &quot;mummy&quot;, one of the greatest dinosaur fossils ever collected. Impressions of skin are preserved over almost the entire body. Around the base of the limbs, on the neck, and at other joints, the skin is folded, like that surrounding the joints of an elephant, presumably to allow flexibility during movement. <a href=\"http://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/past-exhibitions/dinosaurs-ancient-fossils-new-discoveries/for-educators/fossilized-fashion-how-dinosaurs-looked\">Classroom activity: Fossilized Fashion</a>"

Recent research involving microscopic analyses of the cellular structure of dinosaur bone has revolutionized our answers to these mysteries. Dinosaur bones contain growth rings, somewhat like the rings in tree trunks, which reveal yearly periods of rapid and slow growth. These studies, done in conjunction with paleontologists at AMNH, document that that <em>Tyrannosaurus</em>, which attained a weight of more than 10,000 pounds as an adult, reached sexual maturity at about 20 years of age and lived for up to 28 years."

In warm-blooded animals, a complex system of closely spaced cavities, called the Haversian system, permeates the bone. By cutting bones of extinct, non-avian dinosaurs into thin slices and examining them under the microscope, we can look for these characteristics. In most non-avian dinosaurs, the microstructure of the bone looks more like that of warm-blooded animals, but the evidence is not conclusive."

msgid "Scientifically, the group called dinosaurs includes all the animals that evolved from the very first dinosaur, the common ancestor. A key evolutionary innovation of dinosaurs is that they walk with a fully erect posture, holding their hind legs vertically under their hips. The top of the thighbone (or femur) has a knob or head that sticks out to the side of the rest of the bone and fits into the hip socket (or acetabulum) in the pelvis. The hip socket has a hole in the center, as well as a rim of bone along the upper margin, which helps support the weight of the body on the leg. Since these features are present in all known dinosaurs, we deduce that they first evolved in the common ancestor."

msgid "The malaria parasite and its human hosts are locked in an evolutionary arms race. The parasite kills more than a million people every year. Humans fight back with gradual genetic adaptation and better drugs. The parasite then adapts to evolve drug resistance. Watch as immunologist Dyann Wirth and her team at the Harvard School of Public Health study the evolutionary adaptations of Senegalese people and their malaria parasites in the field and in the lab. The scientists are seeking signs of natural selection at a molecular level to help fight malaria in a smarter way."

Travel to the University of California&#39;s Lick Observatory to learn how astrophysicists use distant stellar explosions to observe the expansion of space.
