One example of this process is when radiation from the sun is absorbed by a seat in a football stadium. The atoms that make up the stadium seat absorb the energy, which causes the atoms in the seat to  start vibrating faster. From the viewpoint of the person trying to sit in the seat, this makes the seat feel hot."

msgid "When studying the concept of force, we can look to history to find mathematical principles that guide the laws of motion. Sir Isaac Newton was one of the most famous scientists of the 17th century to study the laws of forces and motion. Through careful study of how objects react to various forces, Newton developed the Three Laws of Motion. Below are explanations of each law and how these laws can be applied to football."
