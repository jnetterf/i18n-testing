"Several events in 1786 helped to create a consensus behind the need to create a stronger federal government. Congress was unable to referee border disputes between various states under the Articles of Confederation, despite the attempts of delegates from states like Maryland and Virginia to meet at the Annapolis Convention. The nation also seemed to face the threat of domestic rebellions as illustrated by Shays' Rebellion in Massachusetts. This led to support for the Constitutional Convention and the later ratification of the Constitution.\n"

"Slavery as an institution contradicted the ideals at the heart of the Declaration, especially its references to the unalienable right of \"liberty.\" Jefferson, who owned thousands of acres of land in Virginia as well as more than a hundred slaves seemed to embody the contradiction, one which he struggled with for the entirety of his life. In 1791, the African-American author and scientist Benjamin Banneker wrote Thomas Jefferson reminding him of the colonial struggle for independence and protesting the injustice of slavery.\n"

"The armed conflict between Britain and the American colonies began in April of 1775 at Lexington and Concord where British forces fought against militiamen from Massachusetts. The War was the culmination of a long dispute over issues of representation and taxation between Britain and its colonies that had been ongoing since the 1760s. Since the colonists had been subjects of the King, they would not have signed a peace treaty with Britain.\n"

Their explanations looked to both self-evident truths discerned by human reason and the fact that the Creator was the source of these rights.
