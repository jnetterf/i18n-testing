He tells us about a famous argument that it can&#39;t, sometimes called &#39;the knowledge argument&#39; or &#39;the Mary argument&#39;, due to philosopher Frank Jackson. If the argument is right, then there are certain aspects of the world that we can&#39;t learn about through science.

"In this video, Monte explores an approach to the question &ldquo;What is the purpose of life?&rdquo; developed by the Greek Philosopher Aristotle (384-322 BC). Aristotle reasoned that just as artificial things (such as tools and workers) have characteristic capabilities with respect to which they are judged to be good or do well, so each kind of natural thing (including plants and humans) has characteristic capabilities with respect to which can be judged, objectively, to be good or do well. For plants and animals these mostly have to do with nutrition and reproduction, and in the case of animals, pleasure and pain. For humans, these vegetative and animal capabilities are necessary but not sufficient for our flourishing. Since reason and the use of language are the unique and highest capabilities of humans, the cultivation and exercise of intellectual friendships and partnerships, moral and political virtue, scientific knowledge and (above all) theoretical philosophy, was argued by Aristotle to be the ultimate purpose of human life.<br />\n"

"Part 1 of a trilogy. Greg lays out a classic argument that God does not exist, called &lsquo;The Problem of Evil&rsquo;. He distinguishes two versions of that argument, which are sometimes called &lsquo;the deductive&rsquo; and &lsquo;the evidential&rsquo; version.

"Part 2 of a trilogy. Here, Greg gives a response to the deductive version of the Problem of Evil on behalf of someone who believes that God exists. In thinking about this response, we need to think about whether God can make contradictions true, and whether God can have good reasons for allowing bad things to happen.<br />\n"
