msgid "The extinction of non-avian dinosaurs except birds at the end of the Cretaceous has intrigued paleontologists for more than a century. One theory is that an asteroid impact 65 million years ago off the coast of Mexico generated massive tsunamis, with impact debris cutting off sunlight for months, stopping photosynthesis and causing freezing temperatures. Chemical reactions in the atmosphere caused acid rain and long-term global warming, all of which extinguished non-avian dinosaurs. However, at the same time, massive lava flows erupted across what is now southwest India. The eruptions probably caused many of the same effects as the asteroid impact. Although most scientists believe that the impact was the final blow for non-avian dinosaurs, both events could well have played a role. "

"To learn about ancient life, scientists study fossils. Finding these traces of ancient life takes time and experience. Paleontologists search carefully for bits of exposed bone, then typically transport the large piece of rock that contains the fossil back to the lab. Trackways provide some of the best clues about dinosaur behavior. Studying living birds and other reptiles, which are related to dinosaurs, gives insight into behavior and biology. Paleontologists also turn \n"
"to experts in other ﬁelds. For example, geochemists analyze fossil bones and teeth for clues about paleoclimate, while paleobotanists examine coprolites for the physical and chemical traces of ancient plants. Together, these scientists are ﬁlling in the picture of what these giant dinosaurs ate, how fast they grew, and how long they lived."

It connects seemingly unrelated features and events of the planet — its continents and oceans, its mountains, its volcanoes and earthquakes — to a single global process. That process is the slow movement of plates on the Earth’s surface. These rigid plates are continually being formed, altered, and consumed. They move on the mantle below and carry the continents along with them."

Since a Neanderthal skullcap was discovered in 1856, thousands more fossils have helped paleoanthropologists piece together the story of our ancient ancestors, from early hominins who lived more than six million years ago to modern Homo sapiens, who evolved 200,000 to 150,000 years ago. In the 1990s, geneticists joined the effort, using DNA to shed light on how modern humans are related to one another and what makes our species unique.
