"* **Purchase APR:** The rate applied to credit card purchases.\n"
"* **Cash advance APR:** The cost of borrowing cash from your credit card tends to be higher. There may be a different APR for balance transfers, checks or certain types of cash advances. Cash advances do not have a grace period.\n"
"* **Penalty APR:** Usually the highest APR. It may be applied to certain balances when you violate the card terms and conditions like failing to make payments on time.\n"

When deciding between credit cards, APR can help you compare how expensive a transaction will be on each one.

However, with an adjustable-rate mortgage, your rate and payments can potentially increase or decrease. If interest rates are rising, check with your lender to find out how much your payment will increase and if it benefits you to refinance into a fixed-rate loan. If you’re planning to refinance a mortgage or you’re searching for a new fixed-rate loan, doing so after the Fed has trimmed rates might allow you to lock in a lower interest rate.

It can also lower your monthly payments by extending the repayment term up to 30 years. This may then open the door to a more gradual and manageable payment schedule. One consideration: Combining loans could cause you to lose interest rate discounts or other benefits associated with the original loans."

Under certain circumstances, the servicer is required to grant you forbearance—for example, if you are in a medical or dental internship and you meet specific requirements or you are performing teaching services and would qualify for teacher loan forgiveness.

"* **Housing expenses:** Your emergency fund should include savings for housing expenses such as rent or mortgage, property taxes, insurance and utilities. Protecting the value and integrity of your home is of utmost importance, so it’s a good idea to also include savings for emergency home repairs. \n"
"* **Food:** Estimate your monthly food expenses and include those costs in your emergency fund savings. Save money on food by reducing your food expenses—cut back on dining out, build your shopping list around sale items, and use coupons—then apply those savings to your emergency fund. \n"
"* **Insurance:** Factor in the monthly cost for medical and dental insurance. Remember, if you’re laid off, you may be eligible to stay on your former employer’s health plan for a period of time at your own expense through COBRA—the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act. You’ll also want to factor in the cost of any disability or life insurance policies you may have. \n"
"* **Debt repayment:** Plan for payments on credit cards and other debt in order to protect your credit score. Try to take steps now to get out of debt to avoid the stress of dealing with these expenses if you become unemployed or face a financial challenge.  \n"
"* **Transportation:** If you have a vehicle, your emergency savings should cover necessary costs such as your car loan, auto insurance, basic maintenance, fuel and emergency repairs. \n"
"* **Personal expenses:** Costs related to household supplies, haircuts, clothes and toiletries may seem generally inexpensive but can add up. Remember to include those items when figuring out how much to save for an emergency fund. "

These accounts tend to offer a better return than a regular savings account, but may require a higher minimum balance to avoid fees. "
