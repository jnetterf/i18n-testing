"What happens when a priceless work of art is vandalised? Filmed over 18 months, this video tells the story behind the restoration of Mark Rothko&rsquo;s 1958 painting <em>Black on Maroon</em> after it was unexpectedly graffitied in October 2012. Since being damaged, the painting has undergone over a year of intensive restoration work by the Conservation team and colleagues across the gallery. Nine months of research on how to remove ink from the delicate and aged layers of paint, using special solvents and cleaning methods, were followed by nine months of painstaking work on the painting itself.\n"

"English sculptor Barbara Hepworth (1903-1975) was one of the most outstanding female artists of the 20th century. Her smooth, massive sculptures invite their audiences to engage with and even touch them, and they stand as icons of the modern movement. But although a figure of international standing, Hepworth never achieved the same degree of recognition in her lifetime as male contemporaries Henry Moore or Ben Nicholson (her husband of nearly 20 years).\n"
"<p>Travel to the coastal English town of St Ives, where Hepworth lived and worked until her death in 1975, where many of her sculptures were created and where they continue to stand in the environment they were intended for. If you could see one, how would you interact with a Hepworth sculpture?<br />\n"

"Despite having photographed everything from the Vietnam War to the construction of the Berlin Wall, <a href=\"http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artists/don-mccullin-7026?utm_source=khanacademy.org&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=khan_academy\">Don McCullin</a> doesn&rsquo;t like to be referred to as a war photographer. McCullin has been covering events of global importance since the 1960s by placing himself in the heart of the action armed with nothing but a camera. In this video, he speaks about a series of his photographs in which there are no explicit images of war or violence, but traces of more subtle and insidious instances of conflict, such as the ravaging effect of industrialisation on the English countryside or poverty in major cities. His photographs also illuminate an idea that is central not only to photography, but to art in general: the relationship between text and image. If you had seen any of McCullin&#39;s photographs without titles, would you know where they took place, who they depicted, or what message they were intended to convey?\n"
"\n"
"<p>For McCullin, the camera can reveal the untold truths of a society. It also serves as a tool for healing, allowing the photographer to not only capture an image through its lens but to engage with its subjects in a unique way. Would you agree? Do you think a camera can change the way you see things?</p>\n"

"Participatory art was a new concept when the exhibition Bodyspacemotionthings first went on show at the Tate in 1971. Created by the American artist <a href=\"http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artists/robert-morris-1669?utm_source=khanacademy.org&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=khan_academy\">Robert Morris</a>, it consists of a series of beams, weights, platforms, rollers, tunnels and ramps that people can clamber all over. It closed just four days after opening, due to safety concerns over the wildly enthusiastic reaction of the audience. Take a look at this 2009 recreation of the piece and listen as curators Catherine Wood and Kathy Noble talk about Morris&#39;s vision of art and participation."

"By calling attention to identity, sexuality, politics, and history, women artists have dominated the art debates for the last several decades. Despite this, only a small percentage of gallery collections and displays belong to women artists, even today. So how do we go about talking about women in art history? Learn more about the changing role of female artists in a male dominated art world over the centuries. Join Jemima Kirke as she guides us through a history of women in art, exploring the ways in which they have been represented, underrepresented, and sometimes misrepresented.\n"
"<p>Should there exist a separate Women&rsquo;s Art History to tell this story, or is it simply a matter of inserting women into existing narratives? What about removing the label altogether, and referring to women artists as just artists? Would this ignore an important component of identity or recognise that women and men can be artists in equal measure?&nbsp;How can women artists be sufficiently recognised without distancing them from art history as we know it?</p>\n"

"Since the early 1960s, German-American artist Hans Haacke has been producing controversial work, often seeking to expose systems of power and influence. While some artists might work to engage with local concerns, Haacke brings his art and its topics to a global scale. In this video, he explains his 1978 photographic series <em>A Breed Apart,</em> a group of montages which targets former car manufacturer British Leyland and for its insidious campaigns and actions in apartheid&mdash;or racially segregated&mdash;South Africa. By juxtaposing slick advertising shots with images of Leyland vehicles &ldquo;in action,&rdquo; as he puts it, against the black indigenous population of South Africa, Haacke highlighted the incongruities of the company&rsquo;s stance.\n"

"&quot;Every work of art is political because every work of art is breaking new ground,&quot; says Colombian artist Doris Salcedo. In this video, Salcedo explains why she decided to literally break new ground in Tate Modern&rsquo;s Turbine Hall by splitting the floor open with a long snaking crack in her piece <em>Shibboleth</em>. The word &ldquo;shibboleth&rdquo; refers to a word or custom that can be used to differentiate one group from another, and is therefore a token of power: the power to judge and reject with violence.\n"
"\n"
"<p>What might it mean to refer to such violence in an art museum? For Salcedo, the crack represents a history of racism, running parallel to the history of modernity. As Salcedo comes from a country riven by war, she has always seen conflict and the world from the perspective of the oppressed. The piece is not an attack, but rather a reminder, a question mark and a disruption of the status quo: she invites us to look down into it, and to confront discomforting truths about our world.<br />\n"
"<br />\n"
"If you could create some kind of artistic distruption, what would it be? Would it be in a gallery, or on the street? Would it be confrontational or subtle?<br />\n"

"New Yorker Doug Fishbone talks about his film <em>Elmina</em>, in which he joins the cast of an entirely Ghanaian-written and produced film melodrama as the lead character. There is no explanation for Fishbone&#39;s difference, leading us as viewers to question our preconceptions of fiction, narrative, cinema, and race.&nbsp;Take a look at the artist&#39;s unique project as he guides us through big questions about roles and representations in film."

Former Tate curator Jemima Montagu presents an exhibition of work by artists from Iran, Afghanistan, and Pakistan.

"Syrian artist Hrair Sarkissian was profoundly marked after witnessing a public execution as a child. Having grown up around photographs, Sarkissian decided to use his craft to engage with and document the places that have haunted him the most. Taken in the Syrian cities of Damascus, Aleppo, and Lattakia, Execution Squares takes us to the major public squares in which executions have taken place for civil rather than political crimes. Sarkissian photographed the squares in the early morning when the streets were quiet, around the time when executions are typically carried out.\n"
"<p>Does seeing these empty squares encourage you to imagine that these peaceful places, and that no such acts of violence could have occurred there? Or does knowing Sarkissian&rsquo;s stories of what really happened give these photographs new meaning?</p>\n"

"In photographer Mark Ruwedel&rsquo;s <em>Crossing </em>(2005), we come across a landscape littered with strange and incongruous objects: inner tubes, water bottles, passports, and single shoes are scattered across the desert that stretches over the border between Mexico and Southern California. While we don&rsquo;t see the players in the drama Ruwedel has documented, his photographs reveal the traces they have left behind, both banal and poignant, as the attempt to cross an invisible line in the desert while escaping detection. Ruwedel walked miles along the US-Mexico border and photographed every object he came across in order to tell the story of undocumented migrants attempting to cross the border in secret.\n"

"Palestinian, London-based artist Mona Hatoum creates art that challenging our perceptions of everyday objects. &quot;Often my work is about conflict and contradiction, and that contradiction can be within the actual object,&quot; she explains. One of her sculptures is a simple wheelchair, an unremarkable object apart from the fact that its handles have been replaced with knives. Another is a baby&rsquo;s cot, but one with the bottom taken out and replaced with taut, menacing wires. Sometimes the materials she works with are unexpected, like the soap she used to draw a map of a peace agreement between Israel and Palestine.\n"

"Chinese artist Wang Peng started out as an abstract painter before turning to installations&mdash;at a time when installation and performance art was banned in China. And yet the artist flourished in what could be considered a hostile environment, using the restrictions imposed upon him to play with how far his art could go instead of simply giving in to the ban. In one piece, the artist and his fellow performers blocked the entrance to a gallery by building a wall of bricks in front of it. The next day, police tore down the wall in an ironic subversion, unwittingly taking part in the performance and symbolically opening the gallery back up.\n"
"<p>Underpinning Wang Peng&rsquo;s work is a steadfast resolve to challenge the conventions and boundaries of art. &quot;Your love of art should never be affected by politics,&rdquo; he says. Do you think that an artist can be unaffected by politics but still engage with political and social issues?<br />\n"

"Tate&rsquo;s Conservation Department works hard behind the scenes to ensure that future generations can enjoy the paintings, sculptures, and other works in the collection. But it&rsquo;s not just the old masters that get their attention&ndash;because contemporary artists work in a diverse and sometimes unusual range of materials, the team often undertakes extensive research to help them and see how their works will hold up in the future. Join paintings conservator Natasha Walker as she explains how the team goes about conserving Chris Ofili&rsquo;s paintings by creating replicas of his works and subjecting them to drops, falls, cracks, and accelerated aging processes. With the help of the artist, his assistants, and even an elephant, the team&rsquo;s &ldquo;Chris Ofilis&rdquo; might not be as good as the real thing, but they will help protect the originals well into the future."

"Having moved to the UK in 1976, artist Dia&nbsp;Al-Azzawi found that by viewing Iraq from afar, he could understand more about Iraqi and Arabic culture than if he had remained there. Al-Azzawi&#39;s vast drawing <em>Sabra and Shatila Massacre 1982-3</em>&nbsp;is an example of work that arose from this process of&nbsp;observation. Here&nbsp;Al-Azzawi explains how working from imagination, he depicted the painting&#39;s scenes of chaos&nbsp;in a semi-abstract style to create a work that is not a propaganda piece, but which documents a&nbsp;tragedy.</p>\n"

"YBA (Young British Artist) Fiona Rae&rsquo;s paintings are clever, lively, and full of restless energy. Her abstract canvases are an exuberant collision of painting styles: encrusted surfaces, brushy swathes and watery pools, along with kitsch cartoon elements, which somehow coalesce despite their differences. Similarly exuberant is Rae&rsquo;s method of painting, using an eight-foot-long palette, an array of vivid colours, and a cart full of brushes she uses to craft her canvases.\n"
"<p>Many years into her artistic career,&nbsp;Rae admits she is still amazed by the possibilities of painting, and her passion for paint is evident in the way she speaks about it. Do you think that passion for a particular material can change the way an artist uses it?<br />\n"

A rare female voice in the Beirut art scene from the 1940s onwards, she has spent her career combining Western abstraction with the traditions of Islamic design. But working through civil war and ongoing unrest in Lebanon, she remains virtually unknown outside her own country. At the age of 97, this pioneer of art was belatedly recognised with her first major museum show. Here we travel to Beirut to meet the artist&#39;s daughter at the apartment where Choucair&#39;s work started its journey."

"Nan Goldin began taking photographs as a teenager in Boston, Massachusetts. Her earliest works, black-and-white images of drag queens, were celebrations of the subcultural lifestyle of the community to which she belonged and which she continued to document throughout the 1990s. During this period Goldin also began making images of friends who were dying of AIDS and recorded her experiences of travelling. Her latest work is an intimate investigation into the narrative of childhood, from birth to young adulthood and everything in between.\n"
"<p>Goldin&rsquo;s photographs can be tender and shocking at the same time. What do you think she is trying to say about the human condition in her work?<br />\n"

"Mixed-media artist Cyprian Gaillard is interested in memory, nostalgia, and how we can look at things around us in relation to the things of the past. His electronic opera Desniansky Raion is a combination of film and music that looks at the relics of architectural modernism. In his film, a modern gang fight in a tower bloc neighbourhood of St. Petersburg recalls the battlefield paintings of the 18th century, modernist buildings facing demolition are illuminated with sound and light shows, and a circular suburb outside of Kiev serves as a modern stand-in for Stonehenge. These strange, obsolete, and practically medieval-looking building projects serve as both backdrop and subject, inviting us to look at something modern that evokes images from the past.\n"
"<p>What might Gaillard be trying to say about these modern blocs by juxtaposing them with other historical periods? And what about the presence of violence and demolition? What might it say about our relationship to history?</p>\n"

"Korean artist Do Ho Suh&rsquo;s work is made based on personal memories of architectural spaces. In the case of Staircase-III, he has created an exact replica of the small, narrow staircase that connects his modern New York apartment to that of his landlord. But it also recalls the staircase in his parents&rsquo; traditional Korean house in Seoul, merging two very different memories into one object. Crafted in a light, gauzy fabric, this staircase invites us to think about the nature of transitional spaces (like staircases, bridges, and doors, connecting but also separating two spaces), transparency, light, and the ephemerality of memory.\n"
"<p>&ldquo;The space I&#39;m interested in is not only a physical one, but an intangible, metaphorical, and psychological one,&rdquo; he says. Do you think that the experience of living in Korea and moving to the United States has influenced Do Ho Suh&rsquo;s relationship with art and memory? Does a feeling of cultural displacement allow a person to see things differently, perhaps allowing them to focus on transitional spaces rather than destinations?</p>\n"

"In 2008, professional snowboarder Johno Verity was being filmed when he was taken by surprise and nearly buried by an avalanche. To see if an artist&rsquo;s depiction could measure up to his own experience, Verity took close look at Philip James de Loutherbourg&rsquo;s 1803 painting An Avalanche in the Alps. Looking at the painting gave Verity the chance to reflect upon the memory of his own avalanche survival experience&ndash;and to point out any inconsistencies in the artist&rsquo;s depiction.\n"
"<p>While the billowing clouds of snow and debris evoke the feelings of being in an avalanche, Verity rightfully points out that this painting is just an artist&rsquo;s impression of such an experience. On the other hand, it is important to remember that every time we look at art we are undertaking an act of interpretation&mdash;we all bring personal experience to an artwork, and this influences the way we see and think about it.&nbsp;Do you think&nbsp;an artist capture the feeling of being somewhere without actually having been there him or herself? Does this make their work somehow less effective? And what about artists that depict things that aren&rsquo;t even real?&nbsp;</p>\n"

"Join artist Michael Landy as he rummages through a heap of trash and reminisces about the culmination to his 2001 performance Break Down. Over three years, Landy catalogued each and every one of his worldly possessions and then systematically destroyed them in front of an audience. He draws in inspiration from the work of Swiss painter and sculpture Jean Tinguely, whose 1960 Homage to New York was a great sculptural machine designed to destroy itself and leave nothing behind as a record. Although Tinguely&rsquo;s piece failed to self-destruct and was prematurely shut down by the fire brigade, it left behind an idea that Landy took up in his own work, decades later.\n"
"<p>What&rsquo;s the point of a self-destructing work of art? Is the work in the object itself, or in the performance around it? And in a world in which everything can be documented in images and videos, can a work of art every really erase itself from memory?</p>\n"

"Sometimes art conservators go to great lengths to fulfil their roles. In this case, conservator Rachel Barker has travelled all the way to Beirut, Lebanon, where she has set up a temporary conservation studio in artist Saloua Raouda Choucair&rsquo;s apartment, where her collection of work is stored. As a consequence of the changeable climate and environment, many of Choucair&rsquo;s works have exhibited some form of damage&ndash;and this is where the conservation team steps in to stabilise these pieces so they can travel safely to London and be exhibited at Tate Modern.\n"

"Surrealist Eileen Agar left behind a rich collection of archival material, a series of very personal and original objects that illustrate her creative process and enrich our understanding of her practice. Entering Agar&rsquo;s archives is almost like entering her mind, as one archivist puts it&mdash;within it you can see direct inspirations for specific works she produced throughout her lifetime. Among her sketches and drawings are the bits and pieces that littered her gallery, giving us a full picture of the materials she was engaging with.\n"
"<p>But Agar&rsquo;s archive includes her private correspondence as well, which allows us a look into her personal life. Among her correspondence is a series of love letters from fellow British artist Paul Nash, telling the story of their affair.

Is it simply voyeuristic, or does the intersection of these documents allow us to look at a much broader cultural history?<br />\n"

"By the 1930s, painter Graham Sutherland had become a major figure in British art and continued to be influential until his death in the 1970s. His landscapes, organic forms, and surrealist figures were often conceived in the pages of his sketchbooks, which can be seen today in the Tate archives. Because of their age and fragility, these sketchbooks are being completely digitised as to preserve them and allow the public to view and interact with them. Sutherland&rsquo;s sketchbooks are essential to understanding the artist&rsquo;s practice: they are rough, paint-spattered, and covered in marks, giving us a glimpse into Sutherland&rsquo;s hands-on approach to planning and creating a painting.\n"
"<p>Seeing an actual work of art is one thing, but what benefits could there be to preserving art digitally? Does it allow for us to interact with art in ways we might never be able to handle the original? Is it a useful tool for people who can&rsquo;t physically come to a museum or gallery?</p>\n"

"At the climax of World War II, Polish-Jewish artist Josef Herman finally left his war-torn home to seek refuge abroad. In 1944, he settled in the South Wales mining town of Ystradgynlais which would be his home for years to come and became deeply involved with the local community. Every morning he would sketch the miners and their families, creating pictures that capture the grandeur and sadness of the working man, the dignity of manual labour, and the relentless difficulty faced by the miners each and every day. Take a look at how Herman&rsquo;s sketches and archival drawings bring his time in Ystradgynlais to life.\n"

"In this project, artist Harold Offeh worked in collaboration with students and teachers to explore live art performance and its relationship to documentation and archive. How can a time-based work of art like a performance piece be documented and preserved? What are the differences between documenting a performance through photography, film, and writing, and the live experience of the performance itself? Inspired by artist Vito Acconci&rsquo;s correspondence with a curator outlining the details of his performances, Offeh and his collaborators explore these ideas through a performance and archiving process of their own.\n"

"From 1940 to 1941,&nbsp; during the second world war, thousands of German and Austrian nationals were interned in Great Britain. Among the many in the Hutchinson internment camp was German painter and sculptor Kurt Schwitters, who continued to work despite facing difficult conditions and a lack of materials. Bolstered by the strong artistic and intellectual community that developed within the camp, Schwitters continued to paint, sculpt, and craft using materials as diverse as old wood from a piano, vinyl, and even porridge! Artistic exhibitions and even a theatre were developed in the camp, and the imprisoned artistic community flourished. By chance, art historian Klaus Hinrichsen was interned with Schwitters, and as such he produced a careful series of documents that captured their time&ndash;and Schwitters&rsquo; work&ndash;in the internment camp.\n"
"<p>By a very lucky twist of fate, Schwitters was interned with not only a community of fellow artists but also a master archivist in the form of Hinrichsen, who made sure to preserve Schwitters&rsquo; work and process. This fortuitous archive remains as a testament to what artists can produce even if in confinement. Can you think of any other artists that produced great work in the face of difficulty?<br />\n"

Join a group of young Londoners as they answer that question while researching, designing, and creating a fashion collection inspired by the Tate Britain art and archive collections. After looking at the Tate displays and archives and thinking about the idea of chronology, these students created garments and jewellery inspired by the history of design. In this case, the archive served as a creative laboratory, providing sources of inspiration and allowing the students to feel more confident and involved with the works of art themselves."

"In 2013, artist Yuri Suzuki created an immersive sound installation using music, audio archives, and even visitor recordings to act as a &ldquo;soundtrack&rdquo; to the Tate Britain collection. Using juke boxes in the gallery, Suzuki created an eclectic archive of sound that visitors could browse and listen to in conjunction with what they were seeing. The juke boxes were filled with sound material including clips of artists speaking about their work, lectures by curators, personal letters from artists like Paul Nash, and music inspired by the art in the gallery.

"In artist Tania Bruguera&rsquo;s 2007 performance <em>Tatlin&rsquo;s Whisper #5</em>, unwitting gallery-goers are confronted by mounted police who ride back and forth throughout the gallery space, corralling people and controlling their movements. Visitors who expect to walk freely through the museum are presented instead with a controlled and threatening environment. In this video, the Cuban artist talks about her performance work and explains why, instead of presenting images that can be viewed at a safe distance, she wants people to personally experience the dynamics of power. Performance art has the unique power of being able to activate viewers and invite them to become part of the artwork, giving them a sense of power they might not otherwise experience in a gallery setting. But in this case Bruguera has turned performance art on its head, and instead of empowering her audience she intentionally makes them feel disempowered.\n"

"&quot;When you are doing political work, ambiguity is very dangerous. How do you balance clarity with enough emotion with sufficient creative space?&quot; In another performance by Cuban artist Tania Bruguera, we are confronted with questions about immigration, nationalism, and what it means to be a citizen of the world. After lining up to visit the exhibition, some visitors are required to pass an &ldquo;immigration test&rdquo; and a polygraph test before being granted access to the inner gallery. Once inside, the darkened space is lit only by the sparks of a migrant worker welding a sign. The sign reads &ldquo;Arbeit Macht Frei&rdquo; (&ldquo;work makes you free&rdquo;)&ndash;the very same words that hung over the entrance to the Nazi concentration camp in Auschwitz.\n"
"<p>In this case the gallery provides a more secluded space in which to confront and contemplate issues of discrimination and nationalism. What do you think Bruguera is trying to say with this piece?<br />\n"

"&ldquo;Going from one political formation to another is a big, radical change,&rdquo; says Lithuanian artist Deimantas Narkevicius. Originally trained as a sculptor, Narkevicius soon began working with film, now using it to explore how we interact with memory in the face of ideology and oppression. His films examine the relationship between personal memory and political history, particularly in relation to the profound social changes experienced in Eastern Europe. Employing archival footage, voice-overs, re-enactments and found photographs, Narkevicius&#39;s films reinterpret historical events by placing them in different narrative structures, such as memoir, documentary, and drama.\n"
"<p>Narkevicius believes that stories and novels can be &ldquo;more authentic&rdquo; than historical documents. What do you think he means by this? More authentic in what way?</p>\n"

"Shocking and often made of contradictory images, the photomontages of artist Peter Kennard leave a mark on their viewers. For the past four decades Kennard has consistently challenged power structures and injustice, from his anti-nuclear works of the 1980s to the powerful images he created in response to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Kennard has created a legacy of powerful work that stands as an open confrontation to political injustice. He creates montages using images of war, conflict, and what he calls &ldquo;collateral damage&rdquo;&mdash;usually in the form of human beings&mdash;to protest, comment, and reflect upon global conflicts. Join Kennard on a tour of his studio as he explains his work.\n"

"After his work was condemned as <a href=\"http://www.tate.org.uk/learn/online-resources/glossary/d/degenerate-art\">&ldquo;degenerate&rdquo;</a> by the Nazi government, German painter, sculptor, typographer, and writer Kurt Schwitters chose to leave Germany in 1937, escaping first to Norway and eventually to Britain. He was one of many German exiles, including a significant number of artists, who were interned in a camp on the Isle of Man during the Second World War. During his time in the camp and for many years later, Schwitters made hundreds of portraits in an effort to earn a living and document the lives and faces of those not on the front line.\n"

"In October 2010, photographer Simon Norfolk began a series of new photographs in Afghanistan, which takes its cue from the work of nineteenth-century British photographer John Burke.

"<p>Conceived as a collaborative project with Burke across time, Norfolk&rsquo;s new body of work is presented alongside Burke&#39;s original portfolios. In doing so, these photographs go beyond documentary and begin to speak not only to each other, but to their viewers in new and thought-provoking ways. Could Burke&rsquo;s 150-year-old photographs have something to say about modern warfare in Afghanistan? Or could Norfolk&rsquo;s new images shed light on a 19th century conflict?</p>\n"

"With a Hungarian mother, Sikh father, and an international education spanning Budapest and Paris, artist Amrita Sher-Gil (1913-1941) has been called India&#39;s Frida Kahlo. Sher-Gil was just 28 when she died but was already recognised as one of India&#39;s most important artists. In this film her nephew Vivan Sundaram, an artist in his own right, talks about her legacy and the international scope of her influences."

Seeing the traditional artistic methods, subjects, and media still dominant in art schools and museums, many young artists grew keenly aware of the disconnect between these established practices and the popular culture that defined their everyday lives. So they turned away from tradition and looked to Hollywood movies, advertising, product packaging, pop music and comic books for their&nbsp;source material, creating a movement that both celebrated and critiqued the consumer culture they lived in.&nbsp;Join actor Alan Cumming as he whips through the history of pop art in America and Britain, from Andy Warhol to Peter Blake.<br />\n"

Since the mid-1960s, her work has been exemplary of what she calls the &quot;other pops&quot;, or the engagements with pop art and the ideals of the movement that were thriving beyond the US and UK at the time. Her work often sought&nbsp;a prominent role for women, using it as a language to reflect on what the role of women in society was in the &#39;60s. Influenced by the socio-political upheavals of the time, her practice is mainly based around functional, everyday objects, like sculptures that have been made into chests of drawers. Her work&nbsp;<em>Red Coat</em>&nbsp;(1969) was created for improvised performances in public spaces, and presents the human body as a conceptual piece of art. Stripping its wearers of any particular identity, it immerses them in a communal performance of equality.&nbsp;<br />\n"

In the 1960s, Saint Phalle emerged as a powerful and original figure in a highly masculine international Pop arts world. She began with highly decorative, colourful paintings before moving on to creative assemblages and landscapes using objects found throughout the household, such as toys, broken plates, and kitchen gloves. Look closely at her&nbsp;<em>Self Portrait&nbsp;</em>(1958), a dark and visibly tortured depiction, and you&#39;ll see that her own figure is made up of shards of glass and household trinkets. Like Nicola L and other female Pop artists around the world, Saint Phalle used her work to explore the roles of women in art in society, through pieces such as&nbsp;<em>Shooting Pictures</em>, in which she fired a .22 rifle into bags of paint strapped to a canvas, and the &quot;Nanas&quot;, her bold and colourful sculptures of monstrously feminine figures.<br />\n"

"<a href=\"http://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-modern/exhibition/ey-exhibition-world-goes-pop/artist-biography/parviz-tanavoli\">Parviz Tanavoli</a> is a pioneering figure of contemporary Iranian art, blending Persian traditions and modern sculpture. Here, the artist talks about his 1975 work&nbsp;<em>Disciples of Sheikh San&#39;an&nbsp;</em>&ndash; a woollen rug blending colourful, poppy imagery with traditional techniques &ndash; and its related screen prints.&nbsp;Tanavoli&rsquo;s practice, developed throughout the 1960s and 1970s, is characterised by the incorporation of traditional Persian techniques, notably everyday crafts found in the blacksmiths, foundries and workshops of Tehran, and traditional subjects such as popular love stories from Persian poetry.&nbsp;&nbsp;His series of screenprints celebrate Persian myths and symbols through a modern visual language.<br />\n"
"<br />\n"
"While he never considered himself a pop artist, Tanavoli worked contemporaneously with pop In the &#39;60s, and other artists saw him as part of the movement. For Tanavoli, &quot;pop art&quot; referred to a universal movement across countries and boundaries.&nbsp;Does an artist really get to choose which movement he or she once belonged to, or is it up to historians to look back and determine the course of art history?"

Drawing on the simplified techniques of sign painters, Caulfield dispensed with visual brushwork and distracting detail, simplifying everyday objects to basic black outlines and fills of uniform colour. Through this simplification, Caulfield took ordinary images and turned them into something iconic.

He even pre-dates some of his pop art colleagues, having worked with comic book images before <a href=\"http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artists/roy-lichtenstein-1508?utm_source=khanacademy.org&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=khan_academy\">Lichtenstein</a>, and with sculptures of consumer goods even before <a href=\"http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artists/andy-warhol-2121?utm_source=khanacademy.org&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=khan_academy\">Warhol</a>.<br />\n"

"Blake says that he sees his studio as a museum, and that &quot;the act of collecting is a conceptual art form.&quot; When does a collection become a work of art? Can curating and arranging a group of objects be considered an artwork?"

"<a href=\"http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artists/roy-lichtenstein-1508\">Roy Lichtenstein</a> is one of America&#39;s foremost pop artists. In the 1960s, he broke with the established traditions of <a href=\"http://www.tate.org.uk/learn/online-resources/glossary/a/abstract-expressionism?utm_source=khanacademy.org&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=khan_academy\">abstract expressionism</a>, choosing instead to create paintings that mimicked the the techniques of printed materials (such as the famous Ben-Day dots) and drawing on popular imagery from comic strips, advertisements, and other printed sources. Lichtenstein makes us think about the paradox of being an artist -- someone who we often think of using their hands to make something -- in an age of mechanically produced and printed images. This mass production of images challenged not only the tradition of hand-painting but also the perceived originality of painters at the time, so Lichtenstein created work that both drew on and parodied popular imagery. Take a look back in time at Lichtenstein&rsquo;s legacy through a few of his key paintings, like&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/lichtenstein-whaam-t00897?utm_source=khanacademy.org&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=khan_academy\"><em>Whaaam</em></a>&nbsp;(1963).<br />\n"
"<br />\n"
"Lichtenstein once said: &quot;The things I have parodied, I really admire.&quot; How could that be? How do you think art can celebrate and critique something at once?"

"Snail juice, meteor dust and potatoes... just some of the unusual materials explored by German artist <a href=\"http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artists/sigmar-polke-2213\">Sigmar Polke</a>. Polke was one of the most significant German artists to emerge in the 1960s, making art in parallel to more &quot;mainstream&quot; Pop in a huge range of materials from painting, drawing and film to potatoes, bubble wrap, and arsenic-based paints. As a young man and self-professed member of a group called the <a href=\"http://www.tate.org.uk/learn/online-resources/glossary/c/capitalist-realism\">Capitalist Realists</a>, Polke created work that responded to the beginnings of consumer society and popular imagery in West Germany, painting objects like socks, shirts, and plastic tubs in vibrant colours. In the early &#39;60s, Polke worked with halftone images &ndash; a printing technique using series of dots, not unlike Lichtenstein&#39;s Ben-Day dots &ndash; taken from newspapers and other popular printed matter. He later shifted to overlaying images, working with larger canvases, and making use of more unconventional materials. Through his work, Polke confronted difficult truths about the world he lived in &ndash; such as Nazism and the Berlin Wall &ndash; including those of a consumer, image-driven society.<br />\n"

"What do you think makes Pop art in Germany so different from more mainstream understandings of Pop, like in the US and UK? Or are the two more similar than they are different?"

Join Loach as he explains why he wishes he could spend time with 19th century artist <a href=\"http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artists/william-hogarth-265?utm_source=khanacademy.org&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=khan_academy\">William Hogarth</a> and the servants he painted (and not the fine dandies and aristocrats in other portraits at Tate Britain.)"

"Now let&rsquo;s get the paints out and get to grips with colour. How can you capture the feeling of a sunset over the river? Although it was one of Turner&rsquo;s favourite subjects, painting a sunset is a tricky task, one fraught with difficulties and always bordering on clich&eacute;. Take a look at how Mark Chaplin attempts to emulate Turner&rsquo;s use of colour, trying to capture the emotional feeling of a scene through colour changes both subtle and bold.&nbsp;"

In this video, learn about drafting, designing, and establishing rhythm with lines, which are used for more than just describing the shape of things. Many artists, and Turner in particular, would begin with line drawings in order to create a basic description of what their image will eventually become."

"&ldquo;Tone&rdquo; refers to how light or dark something is, and it can both describe a form and bring in elements of drama and subtlety into an image, fleshing out the contours that line has laid out already. Join Mark Chaplin as he explains how to tell a story through tone in same way that Turner would, avoiding the use of varying colours and sticking to only the dark and light tones of one colour in order to sketch a scene with subtlety and atmosphere."

"Starting around 1835, when he was 60 years old, Turner entered the &ldquo;late phase&rdquo; of his life and work. Despite society&rsquo;s view at the time that he was on the edge of senility&ndash;it is said that Queen Victoria thought him quite mad&ndash;Turner still travelled extensively. He witnessed new cultures and social scenes, exhibited a supreme confidence in his tools, and created work that was so different from that of his contemporaries that they often didn&rsquo;t know what to make of it.\n"
"<p>Some historians believe that the abstract qualities of late Turner made him a very early precursor to Modernism. Despite creating dramatic new textures and visual experiences, Turner synthesised his earlier experiences without abandoning the interests and methods of his past. Was Turner completely outside his time or old fashioned? Or was he simply being true to himself?</p>\n"

"Often referred to as &quot;the painter of light,&quot; what exactly was Turner trying to do with colour and light? Danish-Icelandic artist Olafur Eliasson, known for his pieces exploring elemental materials such as light and air, investigates Turner&rsquo;s use of colour and light through a series of colour experiment paintings. His interest in Turner&rsquo;s paintings stems from the artist&rsquo;s long held interest in atmosphere and dematerialisation. Through analysing pigments, paint production, and application of colour, Eliasson has created visual spaces where the viewers can break away from traditional perspective and hierarchy and simply immerse themselves in the atmospheres of Turner&rsquo;s paintings.\n"
"<p>These colour experiments demonstrate Turner&rsquo;s continued relevance to and fascination for artists today. Do you get a sense of Turner&rsquo;s colours and atmospheres in Eliasson&rsquo;s experiments?<br />\n"

"Catch up with artist Martin Creed as he stages a performance piece at Tate Britain. <em>Work No. 850</em> consists of runners dodging visitors as they sprint through the gallery as fast as they can. It happens every thirty seconds, jolting this normally serene space for an instant. In this video, Creed tells us about some of the ideas behind the piece, how it makes him laugh, and why he thinks that art is &quot;just a word.&quot;"

Ordinary activities like standing in a queue, travelling on an escalator or listening to a gallery tour guide take on strange new dimensions.&nbsp; Artists Dora Garc&iacute;a, Jiř&iacute; Kovanda, Roman Ond&aacute;k, Mario Garcia Torres, Nina Jan Beier and Marie Jan Lund explore the way visitors behave in a museum, subtly intervening to disrupt the usual codes of conduct."

"Marina Abramović is to many people the definitive performance artist, having begun her career in the early 1970s. Her works test the limits of the human body, and even the endurance of audiences who may witness performances lasting hours, days, or weeks. In this film we join her as she shares highlights from her performance works, discusses the amount of work that goes into staging one of her ambitious pieces, and tells us why it&#39;s never easy to explain what she does."

"The Vorticists were a British art movement that tried to create a new art for a new world, one of big cities, fast machines, and angular energy. The movement included two women, Helen Saunders and Jessica Dismorr, while Dorothy Shakespear was an unofficial member. Join Biddy Peppin, art historian and a relative of Helen Saunders, as she tells us the story of the female Vorticists and the obstacles they faced in being taken seriously as artists.

"At the age of 92, artist Fran&ccedil;oise Gilot is brimming with creative energy and continues to paint every day.&nbsp;Back in the 1940s, Gilot was Pablo Picasso&rsquo;s lover and muse, and a close affiliate with a generation of artists including Henri Matisse, Fernand Leger, and Georges Braque. In this interview from her New York studio, she talks about what her life was like at the centre of French modernism, and how she learned from her peers yet forged her own style even among the superstars of an art movement. As she puts it, &quot;you have to put the energy of your being into the painting.&rdquo;\n"

"Barbara Hammer is a pivotal figure in American experimental film. An acclaimed pioneer of queer cinema, her prolific output includes the earliest avant-garde films that openly address lesbian life and sexuality. Using her own body, Hammer explores&nbsp;the nature of film itself, appearing to push at the edges of the frame in an effort to push cinema from the its typical rectangular form to something new&ndash;like the circle. With this new circular form, Hammer takes film off the screen and projects it into the space an audience is in, making it necessary to move to view the film.\n"

"<p>In addition to pushing the boundaries of film, Hammer has pushed for acceptance of the female body and sexuality, and a break from artifice and disguise. How does art that challenges its medium lend itself to challenging social issues?</p>\n"

"In a piece for the Folkestone Triennial 2011, artist Cornelia Parker immortalised one local woman in a sculpture perched upon a seaside rock. Parker selected 38-year-old mother of two Georgina Baker as the model of her version of Copenhagen&rsquo;s Little Mermaid sculpture. Danish artist Edvard Eriksen&rsquo;s original was cast in 1913, and he created its dainty fairy-tale figure by fusing the physical characteristics of his wife and a ballerina. Parker, on the other hand, modelled her sculpture in the image of a real woman, casting her body in bronze with complete realism, both imbuing her figure with monumentality while turning an idealised character into a real person.\n"
"<p>What do you think Parker is encouraging us to think about with this sculpture? Is she defying the notion that only idealised female bodies have a place in art, or perhaps encouraging us to see the everyday as something more heroic?<br />\n"

"What if you woke up one morning as the opposite sex? Israeli artist Keren Cytter&rsquo;s live piece bridges dance, theatre, and film in a performance that envisions a world in which every man has mysteriously woken up in the morning as a woman, and vice versa. The repercussions of this event have a domino effect on society, sexual politics, and personal identity, ultimately leading to a revolution of the men-turned-women who are suddenly aware of the effects of marginalisation, as Cytter playfully tells the story via film, language, imagery, choreography, performance and light projections.\n"
"<p>Fiction and reality fuse in History in the Making or the Secret Diaries of Linda Schultz. What does this piece have to say about gender and the notion of change? Is change necessarily good or bad, or a little bit of both?</p>\n"

"Bright, chirpy, and colourful images adorn the walls of Lily van der Stokker&rsquo;s exhibition No Big Deal Thing at Tate St Ives. The Dutch artist, based in Amsterdam and New York, produces elaborate and decorative wall drawings that deal with seemingly banal events like paying bills, cleaning, cooking: the stuff of everyday life. Executing her drawings in a childlike and almost na&iuml;ve manner, van der Stokker also makes use of pattern, decoration, furniture, and the tools of domestic space.\n"
"<p>Merging feminism, conceptual art and pop art, van der Stokker describes her practice as &ldquo;non-shouting feminism.&rdquo; Are her drawings really so childish and na&iuml;ve? Or do you think the artist is bringing these quiet, domestic elements into the gallery to make a statement about what belongs there?</p>\n"

"Which is more shocking, a naked women astride a giant banana, or Hugh Hefner in suspenders? Artist Margaret Harrison has been a major female force in the art world since founding the London Women&#39;s Liberation Art Group in 1970 and putting on one of the first single feminist exhibitions. Her playful and ironic drawings of men and women were soon banned by the police, but they served as a potent critique of objectification. In her development as a feminist artist, Harrison moved away from the extravagant irony of her earlier work and turned to more political work, pursuing the issue of equal pay for women and turning documentation and research into an art form.\n"
