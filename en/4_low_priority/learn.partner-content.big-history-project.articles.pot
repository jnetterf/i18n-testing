msgid "Apparently this accelerating expansion of our Universe has not always been the case. It seems to have started about 5 billion years ago, about the same time that our Solar System began. No one knows what anti-gravity force can be pushing the farthest galaxies away faster and faster. Astronomers are calling this unknown force “dark energy” and are estimating that it fills about 70 percent of space. Stay tuned as astronomers learn more about this."

msgid "During Grandma’s life on the farm — until they moved to a city in 1954 — innovations appeared that changed her life immensely. Sometime before 1920 Grandpa bought his first car, a Model-T Ford that had to be hand-cranked to start the engine. (Grandma never learned to drive.) Electricity arrived in 1921, ending the kerosene lamps. Soon there was indoor plumbing, hoses to water the garden, and eventually milking and washing machines, plus radios, telephones, and phonographs. In her 80s Grandma flew on an airplane twice to visit her daughter, who lived in San Salvador, El Salvador."

msgid "In 2011, three astronomers were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for discovering in 1998 that the expansion of our Universe is accelerating, rather than decelerating as they had expected. They found that the galaxies farthest away from our Milky Way galaxy are flying away from us faster than the galaxies nearer to us. The astronomers discovered this by charting changes in the distances of far galaxies, which they measured by observing supernovae that exploded in them. This means simply that the expansion of our Universe is happening at a faster and faster rate. That is, it is accelerating."

msgid "Let’s look at the length of time that each of the major periods of human history has lasted. The Paleolithic era, or the era of hunting and gathering, lasted from the beginning of our species about 250,000 years ago to about 10,000 years ago. That’s about 240,000 years, or 240 millennia. The period of agriculture lasted about 10,000 years, or 10 millennia, while the modern industrial era has lasted 200 years, or a fifth of a millennium. Do you see a pattern of accelerating change? Each era lasted for a much shorter period of time than the earlier one. Now we seem already to be near the beginning of a new era, since we cannot continue long in our present mode: oil is running out, and the burning of fossil fuels is changing our climate."

At that time Grandpa already had his first Ford tractor, but they had no electricity, car, radio, or telephone. They traveled only as far as they could walk, or as far as horses could pull a sleigh in winter or a buggy in summer. On special occasions they might take a train. They milked the cows by hand and pumped water into the kitchen by hand. Grandma hung the laundry on lines to dry and grew their vegetables in her gardens. The farm had kerosene lamps, wood stoves for cooking and heating, and a privy (toilet) outside. Everyone bathed in the kitchen in a large wooden tub. Grandma said they were clean and happy."

msgid "The force that propels the acceleration of change in human societies today is the burning of fossil fuels — coal, oil, and natural gas — and the technological innovations of the modern era. Oil came into use in the early 20th century, revolutionizing transportation by fueling cars, trucks, tractors, airplanes, and tanks. During the 20th century energy use in the world expanded 13-fold, which included oil production soaring sixfold just from 1950 to 1973\\. The three fossil fuels provide energy that originated from the Sun and was sent to Earth millions of years ago, supporting early life forms, preserved somewhat in their remains and then retained underground or under the sea until humans retrieve it. This extra energy propels our food production and our technologies (transportation, communications, financial systems, space exploration, and military actions). Our global civilization is based on fossil fuels at the present time. As of 2010 only about 16 percent of global energy comes from renewable sources."

The answer seems to lie in the increased interplay of energy flowing through human systems and increasing innovations in human technology."

msgid "Zooming in on the 20th century, we might begin by looking at the increase of human population. In 1900 the Earth had 1.6 billion people, in 1950 it had 2.5 billion, and in 2000 it had 6.1 billion. In other words, it just about doubled twice in one century. In the lifetime of anyone who lived through the last half of the 20th century, the human population doubled in 40 years. This has never happened before in anyone’s lifetime. Since 2000 the rate of population growth has slowed somewhat, but the human population has still increased to 7 billion. This total represents an enormous, rapid, and unprecedented change for humans and for the planet."

It seems to have started about 5 billion years ago, about the same time that our Solar System began. No one knows what anti-gravity force can be pushing the farthest galaxies away faster and faster. Astronomers are calling this unknown force “dark energy” and are estimating that it fills about 70 percent of space. Stay tuned as astronomers learn more about this."

In Japan, the monarchy proved flexible enough to survive through early industrialization. In Russia, a profoundly rural country, the czar and the nobility undertook industrialization while trying to retain their dominance. Factory workers often worked 13-hour days without any legal rights. Discontent erupted repeatedly, and eventually a revolution brought the Communist party to power in 1917."

When they attached a steam engine to these machines, they could easily outproduce India, up until then the world’s leading producer of cotton cloth. One steam engine could power many spindles and looms. This meant that people had to leave their homes and work together in factories."

Building a national railroad system proved an essential part of industrialization. Belgium began its railroads in 1834, France in 1842, Switzerland in 1847, and Germany in the 1850s."

In 1851 they held the first world’s fair, at which they exhibited telegraphs, sewing machines, revolvers, reaping machines, and steam hammers to demonstrate they that were the world’s leading manufacturer of machinery. By this time the characteristics of industrial society — smoke rising from factories, bigger cities and denser populations, railroads — could be seen in many places in Britain."

msgid "Everything changed during the Industrial Revolution, which began around 1750\\. People found an extra source of energy with an incredible capacity for work. That source was fossil fuels — coal, oil, and natural gas, though coal led the way — formed underground from the remains of plants and animals from much earlier geologic times. When these fuels were burned, they released energy, originally from the Sun, that had been stored for hundreds of millions of years."

Now, in the early 21st century, Brazil, China, and India are becoming economic powerhouses, while many European countries are enduring troubled economic times."

msgid "Industrialization began in the United States when Samuel Slater emigrated from Britain to Rhode Island in 1789 and set up the first textile factory on U.S soil. He did this from memory, having left Britain without notes or plans that could have been confiscated by British authorities. Francis Cabot Cowell, of Massachusetts, visited Britain from 1810 to 1812 and returned to set up the first power loom and the first factory combining mechanical spinning and weaving in the States. Railroad construction in America boomed from the 1830s to 1870s. The American Civil War (1861–65) was the first truly industrial war — the increasingly urbanized and factory-based North fighting against the agriculture-focused South — and industrialization grew explosively afterward. By 1900 the United States had overtaken Britain in manufacturing, producing 24 percent of the world’s output."

msgid "We can see powerful feedback cycles everywhere, but perhaps most clearly in technologies of communication and transportation. It took Darwin three years to sail around the world. Today, you can be in Sydney one day and in New York the next. Changes in communications are even more incredible. Just over 500 years ago, the breakthrough technology in communications was printing. Instead of copying the Bible laboriously by hand, printing presses could churn out many copies a day. Printing also aided the spread of ideas such as Copernicus’s and Newton’s views on the Universe. Then, in the 19th century, there came a flood of new technologies — steamships, telegraphs, railways, and telephones — followed in the next century by planes, radios, televisions, rockets, computers, and the Internet. Today almost anyone can communicate instantly with anyone else."

"> One man draws out the wire, another straights it, a third cuts it, a fourth points it, a fifth grinds it at the top for receiving the head; to make the head requires two or three distinct operations; to put it on is a peculiar business, to whiten the pins is another; it is even a trade by itself to put them into the paper; and the important business of making a pin is, in this manner, divided into about eighteen distinct operations.... [An average factory of ten workers] could make among them upwards of forty-eight thousand pins in a day. Each person, therefore...might be considered as making four thousand eight hundred pins in a day. But if they had all wrought separately and independently, and without any of them having been educated to this peculiar business, they certainly could not each of them have made twenty, perhaps not one pin in a day.\n"

msgid "Around 1500 CE, several drastic changes were set in motion. Overseas trade established new networks and boosted collective learning and commercialization. Globally traded currency created an easily recognizable and transferrable store of wealth and medium for exchange. Individual markets, once physical places for the simple exchange of goods, began merging to create the market system, which, according to Heilbroner, “is not just a means of exchanging goods; it is a mechanism for sustaining and maintaining an entire society” (Heilbroner, pp. 26–27). By the 1600s and 1700s, custom and command ceased to exert as much influence as the pursuit of wealth. Rather than survival, obedience, or tradition, it was “the lure of gain...[that] steered the great majority to his or her task” (Heilbroner, p. 21). It was in this era, on the verge of the Industrial Revolution, that Adam Smith lived and worked."

msgid "As a theory, Marxism is arguably more durable. While some believe that communism’s decline disproves Marx, others draw upon his approach to critique economic phenomena on social grounds. Even as capitalism defines most of the world’s economies, Marxism remains alive in “the idea that capitalism can undergo serious scrutiny and adaptation” (Bussing-Burks, p. 95). In other words, Marx’s skepticism about capitalism initiated an ongoing conversation about its shortcomings and how it can be improved. While he was no Marxist, our third economist, John Maynard Keynes, was highly influential in confronting the dilemmas of capitalism in the early 20th century."

msgid "Early economies were also marked by an ambivalent attitude toward money and the pursuit of wealth for its own sake. Writes Heilbroner, “The idea of gain...was quite foreign to the great lower and middle strata of Egyptian, Greek, Roman, and medieval cultures, only scattered throughout Renaissance and Reformation times, and largely absent in the majority of Eastern civilizations” (Heilbroner, pp. 24–25). Those who worked with money (merchants, lenders, and even craftsmen with specialized skills) were often viewed suspiciously and sometimes even punished for innovating within their trades. Consequently, skills and technology advanced gradually and similar jobs and standards extended across many generations."

In addition, Smith argued that people have a natural drive to improve their own lives. This self-interest, he suggested, propels markets to satisfy individual demands by producing the goods and services people want. He called this the “invisible hand,” and wrote, “It is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the baker, that we expect our dinner, but from their regard to their own interest” (_The Wealth of Nations_, p. 20)."

Even without developed cultural, commercial, or legal systems, effective economic decision-making was often imperative for survival."

msgid "Keynes’s analysis of the Great Depression focused on the role of savings. In his 1936 book _The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money_, Keynes argued that excessive savings could lead to economic ruin. A weak economy made businesses hesitant or unable to make investments that created jobs. Without jobs, people had no income that, if spent, would have stimulated demand for more production. Savings increased in anticipation of economic hardship. But then savings dried up as joblessness persisted. Individual rationality (saving in hard times) led to collective irrationality (an unbreakable cycle of economic decline)."

International political economy professors David Balaam and Michael Veseth caution, however, that there is no definitive reading of Marx, and that “Marxism is at once a theory of economics, politics, sociology, and ethics. For some, it is also a call to action” (Balaam & Veseth, p. 73). As a call to action, Marxism was most influential in the 20th century, when it inspired various brands of revolutionary activity, including the Russian Revolution in 1917 and the rise of communist governments in China, Vietnam, and Cuba, as well as in many Eastern European and African nations. It has since fizzled out, with the U.S.S.R. collapsing in the early 1990s, China shifting toward a market-friendly economy, and smaller communist countries that depended on them adopting more market-oriented systems."

msgid "This approach proved relevant in the 1930s and ’40s. The New Deal government relief programs of President Franklin D. Roosevelt were designed to stimulate the economy in the early 1930s, while cuts to the federal budget in the late ’30s caused an immediate economic downturn. Extensive government spending funding World War II coincided with the end of the Depression. While some Keynesian policies had mixed results, the overall picture seemed to confirm Keynes’s arguments, and until the 1970s, Keynesianism predominated American economics. The “Great Society” domestic social programs — including Medicare and education funding — reflected Keynesian thinking. So too did the establishment of many of the institutions that form the basis of international trade and finance, such as the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. While the 1980s and ’90s saw a resurgence in “classical” economic theories closer to Smith than to Keynes, the recent “recession” presents a new opportunity to debate whether Keynesian economics are still viable."

He believed that “capitalists” (the owners of the machines, property, and infrastructure used to produce things) were a separate class from the workers, or “proletariat,” who own nothing but the right to sell their labor in exchange for wages. Marx theorized that capitalists, in competition with each other for profits, would squeeze as much work as possible out of the proletariat at the lowest possible price. Furthermore, competition would cause some capitalists’ firms to fail, increasing unemployment (and thus misery and poverty) among the proletariat. Innovations in technology were not necessarily positive; new machines would add to unemployment (by rendering human labor increasingly inefficient and obsolete) while also making work dull, repetitive, and alienating."

msgid "Yet Marx was not altogether dismissive of capitalism, which he saw as a necessary stage for building a society’s standard of living. But in his view, the proletariat’s discontent would inevitably lead it to overthrow the ruling classes and create a more equitable society, at first socialist (wherein the state would control the economy and distribute resources more evenly) and then purely communist (a stateless, classless, egalitarian society without private property or nationality)."

msgid "[[☃ image 1]]Marx’s attitude toward capitalism was scathing. In an age when “the Industrial Revolution had changed the process of production into a factory system and created a new ruling class of factory owners” (Bussing-Burks, p. 85), Marx perceived injustice, inequality, and the inevitability of change. Marx and his frequent coauthor, Friedrich Engels were outraged at the hardships faced by the working classes of industrial European cities, and they channeled this anger into two monumental written works that formed the basis of modern communism: _The Communist Manifesto_, published in 1848, and a four-volume, 2,500-page opus, _Das Kapital,_ published in 1867."

Buying clothing, deciding what to eat, or seeking a job — all involve considerations of cost, scarcity, and tradeoffs with other options. Whether or not you think of them as such, these are economic decisions."

His machine helped coal mining by quickly pumping water out of the mines, reducing flooding. Subsequent steam engine designs by other inventors, like James Watt, made mining even more efficient."

Large, strong animals presented one such source of energy. Humans started using animals to carry large cargo loads, work agricultural fields, and transport people. Of course, animals required care and had to be housed safely, but in general they provided an excellent energy source for a limited set of applications. Still, the power they provided wasn’t scalable enough for the growing needs of our civilization."

msgid "Coal mining improved, but increasingly the coal that was mined came to be used in the steam engines that supported mining and, eventually, other industries. Demand for coal grew and extraction of this fossil fuel remained energy intensive — and does so to this day. Coal is also heavy to transport, and the burning of it creates noxious pollution. Nevertheless, it largely powered the Industrial Revolution in Britain and the United States, and, while in decline today, is still a relied-upon source of power."

It turns out that oil and natural gas are fairly easy to transport, making them good candidates for fuel on-the-go. We can keep a known amount with us in tanks while we travel. Oil, however, is a finite and expensive resource. Burning oil creates carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas that negatively affects global warming. We have some known oil sources, but the greatest reserves exist in a handful of specific countries, adding political and economic considerations to our environmental concerns. Digging for oil is expensive, resource intensive, and impactful to the environment."

Fire could rip through forests, clearing land in minutes. It could cook meat and vegetables, changing their taste, composition, and “shelf life.” It could burn skin, light the darkness, and exude heat for warmth. Fire was a life-altering form of energy and it was relatively “cheap” — you just had to rub two sticks together (very fast and hard). But it had its limitations."

msgid "What about natural energy sources like wind and solar power? In the last few years we’ve seen significant exploration and growth in both areas. While wind and solar energy present strong alternatives with far less environmental impact, major obstacles remain. Specifically, these two energy sources are highly dependent on their availability — presenting a challenge when winds are quiet or when sunlight is scarce. As we search for ways to better store, save, and transport energy produced from the Sun and wind, these may become more viable alternatives for broad use."

msgid "While life on Earth may have begun at the deep-sea vents in the ocean floor, thriving on chemical energy from beneath the crust, prokaryotes first floated to the ocean’s surface about 3.5 billion years ago. Using photosynthesis, these organisms consumed energy from the Sun and converted it to fuel for growth and ultimately reproduction — and the adaptations that came with subsequent generations. Thus the Sun played an important role in the evolution of life from single-celled organisms to highly complex beings, like people."

The United States dropped two atomic bombs on Japanese cities (Hiroshima and Nagasaki) in 1945 to end World War II. Since then, a handful of nations have tested bombs and several major peacetime accidents at nuclear plants have occurred. But, so far, nuclear power has not been used destructively on a massive scale. Large numbers of bombs exist, and some are on alert to be launched within 15 minutes. Multiple deployments could annihilate millions of people and send large-scale debris up into the atmosphere, blocking the Sun’s rays long enough to produce a “nuclear winter” that would be as destructive to life as the asteroid of 65 million years ago that wiped out the dinosaurs."

msgid "For example, humans now “fix” more nitrogen artificially than all the world’s plants do. (Fixing nitrogen means converting nitrogen from the atmosphere (N2) into ammonia (NH3), so that it is usable in biologic processes.) Most plants cannot convert nitrogen from the air and need to have it added to the soil. But a few kinds of plants, such as legumes, can fix nitrogen with the help of common bacteria that use plants to help it extract nitrogen from the air, which is then stored in the plants’ roots. People fix nitrogen by burning oil or gas to synthesize ammonia from atmospheric nitrogen and hydrogen. For example, synthetic ammonia fertilizers made by burning fossil fuels contribute to increased food production. Human synthesis of nitrogen is altering Earth’s whole nitrogen cycle."

They call short periods of thousands of years “epochs,” longer ones that last tens of millions of years “periods,” and really long ones lasting hundreds of millions of years “eras.” The longest measurements of time are called “eons.” Geologists refer to our current epoch as the Holocene, which started about 10,000 years ago, when the temperature stabilized at a new level of warmth after the last ice age.

Sometimes, like at the end of the last ice age, change speeds up because positive feedback cycles accelerate the process. For example, when glaciers at the poles melt, there is less area of whiteness to reflect some of the Sun’s heat back into space. Instead, the heat is absorbed into the land and water, warming it and causing more melting of the glaciers, which then reflect even less heat; the feedback cycle continues."

A tiny part of Earth’s atmosphere is so-called greenhouse gases, which hold in heat reflected from Earth and do not let it escape into space. One of these greenhouse gases is carbon dioxide (CO2). During the glacial/interglacial cycles of the past million years the CO2 varied approximately 100 parts per million (ppm) — from 180 ppm to 280 ppm — due to processes not affected by humans. Since the Holocene and the beginning of human agriculture, the atmospheric concentration of CO2 has risen from 280 ppm to about 390 ppm, much faster than ever before.

msgid "The foregoing evidence may convince biologists and climate scientists, but geologists have a very specific method of periodization. They look for evidence in the rocks, or at least in layers of mud that will become rock. They are finding that proof. Worldwide sediments contain the radioactive signature of atomic bomb testing in the 1960s. Similar evidence of chlorine from bomb testing and of mercury associated with the burning of coal also exists in ice-core samples."

msgid "There are differing opinions as to what these changes might bring and how humans might be able to overcome them. James Lovelock (1919– ), an English independent scientist, believes that humans have passed the point at which they can control change. Non-human processes are now in control and will bring the planet back into some kind of equilibrium, which may not support much human life. The best we can do, he feels, is to try to adapt to the changes."

Let’s look at a modern portrayal of human origins: “Our hominine ancestors evolved over several million years. But during the last million years, species appeared with very large brains, and our own species, _Homo sapiens_, probably appeared about 200,000 years ago. We know this because we have fossil remains of individuals that seem identical to modern humans, and we begin to find evidence of technological innovation and symbolic activity.” I wrote that, but it is typical of today’s history writing because it is so concerned with evidence. Where there are competing versions of the past, you have to give evidence for yours if you want to be taken seriously."

Ancient storytellers could keep telling stories for days, and poets had many techniques to help them recall long epic poems so they could recite them at will. For example, it seems likely that the Greek poet Homer used similar phrases over and over again, such as “the wine-dark sea,” as well as rhymes and regular rhythms, mainly to help him remember his epics."

The great 19th-century German historian Leopold von Ranke pioneered the modern art of writing history on the basis of detailed archival records.

If you slice through a tree, particularly in a region with lots of seasonal changes, you’ll see “growth rings.” Every year a new layer grows just under the bark. There is often a light part formed early in the year and a darker part that forms later, so each ring represents one year of growth. Wet seasons typically produce thicker rings than dry seasons, so dendochronologists — the scientists who study growth rings — can frequently figure out the exact year in which each layer was formed. They can also see evidence of climatic events such as droughts or forest fires."

Herodotus (c. 484–425 BCE) traveled widely in the eastern Mediterranean as well as to Olbia, on the northern shores of the Black Sea, where he met some of the Scythian pastoral nomads about whom he wrote so vividly. Modern archaeologists have shown that his somewhat gruesome accounts of Scythian royal burials were very accurate.

msgid "We don’t really know when humans first began to share their knowledge of the past. But our understanding of collective learning suggests that they probably did so early on. If we assume, as we have done in this course, that even the earliest members of our species were capable of collective learning, then we must assume that they could share ideas not just about where water holes or lions are, but also about last year’s bush fire, or that fight that took place with the people who live beyond the river, or even of earlier geologic events. All modern foraging societies tell stories about the past, many focused on ancestors, but also on the creation of what’s around us. Indeed, most humans tell “origin stories,” and origin stories count as history because they share ideas about the world."

We also find stories of floods, of gods, and of the creation of the world, some of which made their way into the Jewish scriptures, the Christian Bible, and the Koran. Wherever writing appeared it was used to write accounts of the past. And despite most people not being able to read or write, those accounts started to become the basis for further historical accounts. Written documents began to be seen as more authoritative than oral stories, because once something was written down it was much harder to keep changing the story."

msgid "[[☃ image 1]]But document-based history has some serious limitations. First of all, history based on written documents often only tells us about the lives of the rich and powerful. That’s because until a century or two ago most other people could not read or write, so they weren’t very well represented in the documents of earlier times. Sometimes, archaeology and anthropology can step in by helping us use material objects — houses, clothes, bits of pottery or skeletons — left behind by ordinary people, or by using studies of modern societies that give us some hints about how ordinary people lived in the past."

msgid "Although Japan is so close, Korea has almost none of the volatile volcanic activity of its eastern neighbor. The only volcano is Mount Baekdu in the far north, which at 9,000 feet is also the highest mountain in Korea. Today the mountain contains an extinct crater filled with Heaven Lake; according to ancient legend, this was home to the gods. From Baekdu in the far north all the way to the southern tip of the peninsula, 70 percent of Korea’s land consists of steep-sided mountains. It is their ruggedness rather than their height that has been so influential: the hills made it very difficult to cross from east to west, allowing cultures and kingdoms to develop in relative geographical isolation from each other. One of these, the Silla Kingdom, grew strong enough in its remote southeastern enclave behind the Sobaek Mountains that it eventually overcame the mountainous terrain to conquer the other kingdoms and establish the first unified Korean state."

msgid "Another product of Japan’s tectonic location is that most of the country con- sists of geologically young mountains, driven up by these plate collisions. These mountains are steep and jagged, producing fast-moving streams and regular landslides. The tectonic plate boundaries have also spawned volcanoes, the highest and most famous of which is Mount Fuji at 12,388 feet. These rugged and unstable mountain ranges are unsuitable for farming, limiting to settlement patterns, and difficult to climb or cross, so have been serious barriers for internal transportation and communication from the beginning of Japanese history. This led to the emergence of regionally autonomous states in early Japan, and to an early reliance on water transport."

In just one day the Yangtze River rose an astonishing 53 feet above its normal level, unleashing some of the most destructive floodwaters ever seen. These floods were a product of a “perfect storm” of conditions — monsoons, heavy snowmelt, and tremendous and unexpected rains that pounded huge areas of southern China. As all this water poured into the Yangtze’s tributaries, the river rose until it burst its banks for hundreds of miles. The results were devastating — 40 million people impacted, 24 million forced to relocate, and more than 140,000 people drowned. An area the size of Oklahoma was underwater, and the southern capital city of Nanjing was flooded for six weeks."

Although these might have seemed attractive to early human migrants, few of these caves were the right shape or size to become practical dwellings.

This is an example of why historical processes rely so heavily on the environmental context in which they take place. Big historians believe that understanding geography and climate is necessary background to the study of any civilization. In this essay we take look at the physical geography of China, Korea, and Japan to see how it has influenced the cultural and political history of East Asia."

msgid "The Huang He is also known as “China’s Sorrow” because of the misery its devastating floods have caused. The earliest cities, states, and civilizations of East Asia all appeared along the Huang He – the Xia, Shang, Zhou, Qin, Han, and Tang dynasties were all centered there. So for millennia some of the largest populations in the world lived within the Yellow River system and faced the potential of regular flood devastation. Emperors and court officials tried numerous schemes to control these floods, but with little success."

msgid "The Korean Peninsula extends from northeastern China and is otherwise surrounded by the Yellow Sea to the west, the Sea of Japan to the east, and the Korea Strait connecting the two seas. The Yellow Sea dividing China and the peninsula is only 120 miles wide at its narrowest point, and if you were to sail from southern Korea to Kyushu in Japan on a clear day, land would never be out of sight. The peninsula is about 85,000 square miles — or about the same size as England or the state of Utah. Most of the land is extremely rugged, mountainous, and heavily forested. This presented the first human migrants to Korea with a host of environmental challenges but also a range of possible settlement sites: a long, sinuous coastline with many microenvironments and marine resources, and many wooded interior environments such as river flats, and mountain valleys with access to forest foods, timber, fresh water, and caves."

msgid "The Yangtze also has its great bend to the north, a bend that perhaps has been of even greater consequence to Chinese civilization than its Yellow River counterpart. In southwestern China, all the mountainous valleys are arranged in a north-south direction, products of the twisting of the landscape caused by the collision between the Indian and Asian tectonic plates. The great rivers that flow through these Himalayan valleys, like the south-running Brahmaputra and Mekong, all flow from the Tibetan Plateau in the north toward the seas that lap Southeast Asia."

msgid "The Yangtze would have gone the same way, depriving millions of Chinese people of its life-giving water, were it not for a singular topographical feature called Cloud Mountain. This massive wall of limestone is placed right across the path of the onrushing Yangtze, forcing the river to abruptly interrupt its journey south and turn sharply back to the north. The Chinese attribute the fortuitous placement of Cloud Mountain to the work of legendary emperor Yu the Great, who labored mightily to keep the river in China. Geologists, more accurately, attribute it to a particular quirk in twisting of the plate tectonic collision zone. Either way, without Cloud Mountain, Chinese history would have played out very differently."

Japan sits at the intersection of no fewer than four tectonic plates (part of the Pacific region’s “Ring of Fire”) so has undergone regular violent shaping and upheaval.

Although the plains make up only 13 percent of Japan’s area, their fertility marked them as where the first rice farmers settled, and where the first towns, cities, and states appeared. One of the most important of these plains is the Tsukushi Plain in northern Kyushu. Influenced by nearby civilizations in Korea and China, it became an early center of emerging Japanese culture."

This led to Chinese civilization emerging in the more arable east, north, and south. Isolated by its own “wild west,” China was cut off from the rest of Eurasia and from competing agrarian civilizations. Even today, these formidable topographical barriers, and the vast distances necessary to cross western China, affect China’s relations with its western neighbors. Yet these barriers have their advantages too. Chinese governments from the earliest dynasties have been forced to focus on _internal_ cultural and ethnic integration rather than on _external_ expansion."

msgid "After domesticating other animals, farmers learned to use their livestock not only as a source of food and clothing material but as \"workers\" in the field. It was an \"energy revolution.\" With the benefit of an ox, perhaps bred over several generations to be larger and stronger, farmers were able to till more land, producing larger harvests and eventually generating the kinds of food surpluses that led to other aspects of civilization."

msgid "As with agriculture, the first human civilizations emerged in the Fertile Crescent. More than 5,000 years ago, large agrarian communities became full-fledged cities like Uruk, Ur and Nippur in Mesopotamia and, later, in the Nile Valley of Egypt at Nekhen and Memphis. Agriculture in the Indus Valley fed the growth of cities at Mohenjo-daro and Harappa. Civilization would come thousands of years later in the Americas."

msgid "Due at least in part to the same environmental reasons of geography and climate that affected the rise of agriculture, civilizations emerged much later in the Americas than in Eurasia. The north-south orientation of the Americas slowed down the exchange of information, with the Andes Mountains in South America acting as a natural barrier between different communities. Eventually people congregated in what is now central Mexico and agrarian civilizations like the Olmecs, the Maya and Aztecs emerged. Further south the Incas built an enormous empire based in and near present-day Cuzco, Peru. The Aztec and Inca empires would flourish until 500 years ago when European explorers defeated these cultures in their prime with steel weapons and disease."

msgid "One of the earliest known forms of writing, cuneiform, emerged in Sumer in Mesopotamia about 5,000 years ago. Cuneiform (a later, advanced form is shown here) was produced by pressing the rigid, wedge-shaped edge of a cut reed into wet, unhardened clay. Once the clay dried and hardened, the inscriptions proved extremely durable."

With the advent of irrigation, humans learned to divert water supplies – enabling larger harvests and allowing for storage of water for use by the community."

Athenian merchants had earlier brought knowledge and ideas from Mesopotamia and Egypt; Athenian scientists, philosophers, and playwrights developed and combined cultural traditions that would later spread throughout Europe and serve as a foundation for Western culture.

In 313 CE Emperor Constantine (who ruled from 306 to 337 CE) legalized Christian worship after his own conversion, and by the end of the fourth century it had become the official state religion."

msgid "Alexander died suddenly and mysteriously in 323 BCE after a big drinking party; his empire was divided among three of his generals — Egypt under Ptolemy (not to be confused with the scientist Claudius Ptolemy), Greece and Macedonia under Antigonus, and central Asia under Seleucus. For a little more than a hundred years, these Greek rulers brought Greek culture to their areas. For example, the city of Alexandria at the mouth of the Nile became the most important port in the Mediterranean. The Ptolemaic rulers there funded a museum that served as an institute of higher learning and research; it included a library that by the first century BCE had some 700,000 scrolls. Scholars came from around the Mediterranean to work in Alexandria. There Eratosthenes measured the diameter of the Earth, Euclid wrote the rules of geometry, and the scientist Ptolemy wrote the Algamest, unfortunately ignoring the ideas of Aristarchus, who also studied at Alexandria and theo- rized almost 2,000 years before Copernicus that the Earth circled the Sun."

msgid "Even so, Greco-Roman collective learning managed to live on. Much credit must go to the Ptolemaic rulers in Egypt, who supported scholarship and research at the Museum and Library of Alexandria. Nobody knows for sure what happened to Alexandria’s library, but eventually it disappeared. The part of the city where it stood now lies underwater; in 2004 excavators discovered 13 lecture halls. Three main claims have been made about the library’s destruction: that Julius Caesar accidentally, or on purpose, set part of the city on fire in 48 BC when fighting his rival general, Pompey; that Christians destroyed it in the early fifth century CE; and that Muslims, who took Alexandria in 640 CE, ransacked the library and burned the documents as tinder for their bathhouses. (This was written 300 years after the purported event by a Christian bishop known for describing Muslim atrocities without much documentation.) Possibly all of these events, or versions of them, contributed to the library’s eventual demise."

It conquered some of the Greek colonies on the shores of Anatolia but when the Athenians fought the Persians, they won — on land at Marathon in 490 BCE and in great sea battles. A runner, Phidippides, carried the news of victory the 26 miles from Marathon to Athens and died after shouting, “Rejoice, we conquer.” (The day before he had run 140 miles to Sparta and back, asking for help, which for religious reasons the Spartans wouldn’t give until the Moon was full.) Phidippides’s effort 2,500 years ago also spawned the 26.2-mile marathon running races that are so popular today."

msgid "History books used to refer to the “fall” of Rome in 476 CE when a Germanic general, Odovacar (435–493), became the ruler of the western part of the empire. But the fall was a gradual dissolution, not a sudden collapse. After 200 CE, Rome faced many problems. Strong leadership was lacking; during a 50-year span in the 200s CE there were 26 emperors, only one of whom died a natural death. Epidemics of disease spread along the Silk Roads; afflictions that began in animals — smallpox, measles, mumps, whooping cough — could spread rapidly in urban populations. The Roman world lost about one-quarter of its population before 450 CE. Monetary inflation occurred; people lost confidence in coins and returned to bartering. The dissolving empire meant the decline of urban life, reduced international trade, loss of population, and widespread insecurity for ordinary people."

The more educated Greeks believed in a pantheon of gods, headed by the sky god, Zeus, who emerged triumphant from the battle of the gods. (See the Greek origin story in Unit 1.) Many Greeks believed in mystery religions, which involved secrets known only to initiates and often entailed a savior whose death and resurrection would lead to salvation for followers."

Attica was composed of rocky soil on steep mountains. The poor soil could sustain barley, grapes, and olive trees, and could accommodate sheep and goats, but not much else — just some figs and lentils. Hence, Greeks stayed near the coast and took to the sea for extra food and for trading with other people."

The Romans allowed Jesus to be crucified in the early 30s CE to forestall rebellion, which they believed he was advocating with his message that “the kingdom of God is at hand.”"

In a way, though, the Roman Empire was a vehicle for the spread of Greek culture. The Romans honored many gods, renaming the Greek ones and taking them as their own. Roman statesman Marcus Tullius Cicero (106–43 BCE) adopted a version of Stoicism, a Greek philosophy seeking to identify universal moral standards based on nature and reason; Epicetus and Marcus Aurelius further popularized it. The older mystery religions — the Anatolian rites of Mithras and Cybele and the Egyptian rites of Isis — proved immensely popu- lar in the Roman Empire."

(A republic is a form of government in which delegates represent the interests of varied constituencies.) The poorer classes, called plebeians, insisted on some protections and participation.

msgid "[[☃ image 1]]History books used to refer to the “fall” of Rome in 476 CE when a Germanic general, Odovacar (435–493), became the ruler of the western part of the empire. But the fall was a gradual dissolution, not a sudden collapse. After 200 CE, Rome faced many problems. Strong leadership was lacking; during a 50-year span in the 200s CE there were 26 emperors, only one of whom died a natural death. Epidemics of disease spread along the Silk Roads; afflictions that began in animals — smallpox, measles, mumps, whooping cough — could spread rapidly in urban populations. The Roman world lost about one-quarter of its population before 450 CE. Monetary inflation occurred; people lost confidence in coins and returned to bartering. The dissolving empire meant the decline of urban life, reduced international trade, loss of population, and widespread insecurity for ordinary people."

Why did the majority of people allow this to happen? We can only guess that people needed leadership to manage projects like large-scale irrigation or distribution of surplus food. They also needed armed protection against neighboring groups. At the same time, ambitious priests and rulers could take opportunities to control the food surpluses to increase their own power. Gradually they were able to institutionalize their power, forming political or religious groups that held significant control over the land and people in their jurisdiction."

msgid "Despite all these similarities, some important differences occurred among early civilizations. Perhaps most significant, the civilizations in northern Africa and Eurasia were connected with each other soon after they began, forming an Afro-Eurasian zone that included the trading of goods and the exchange of ideas and technology. Connecting roads went east-west through similar latitudes and there were sea routes between numerous ports. In contrast, early civilizations in the Americas were hardly connected at all. They had fewer kinds of transport animals and fewer routes over difficult terrain that separated the north-south changes in latitude. This difference would prove important when sailors from Europe arrived on the shores of the Americas with horses, guns, steel swords, and germs they had picked up from their domestic animals but had themselves become immune to or tolerant of. The Europeans’ animals and technologies were the result of collective exchanges among several early Afro-Eurasian civilizations."

msgid "If we change our lens to get close-ups of early civilizations, we can see many fascinating details that differ. All the early civilizations developed some form of writing, except the Inca in the Andes, who instead used a system of tying knots in different colored string, called quipu, to record their transactions and possibly even their stories. All early civilizations engaged in warfare except, perhaps, in the Indus Valley, where some arrowheads and spears have been found but no swords, helmets, shields, or chariots. Every civilization with writing started by using pictographs but switched to some form of alphabet, except the Chinese, who still use pictographs in their writing. Every civilization practiced human sacrifice, but the Aztecs used it on a much larger scale than others; they believed that the world would end if the chief god did not receive his daily offering of human blood to keep the Sun shining. While early civilizations shared many common features, the differing details form a mosaic of human culture."

These large states are often called “civilizations.” This word has previously been used to imply superiority or advancement; historians now try to use it simply to mean that civilizations have certain characteristics, primarily density of population and control by elites. This does not mean they are better than other kinds of societies, but they are, by definition, more complex. Since these early civilizations always depended on the farming around them, we call them “agrarian civilizations.”"

Kathleen Kenyon was the first to extensively investigate using modern techniques, back in the 1950s. She was searching for the Bronze Age city named in the Hebrew Bible as the “city of palm trees,” but her excavations quickly revealed evidence of occupation dating back many thousands of years before the Bronze Age. Her trenches reached the remains of an early farming settlement about six acres in area, dated to circa 9600 BCE. Continued excavations revealed even earlier layers, proving that the site had been first occupied, most probably by Natufian foragers, as early as 12,000 BCE. This made Jericho the oldest continuously inhabited settlement in all human history."

It was only with the end of the last ice age early in the Holocene epoch, some 13,000 years ago, that the first evidence of farming begins to appear in the archaeological record. Conditions were warmer and more stable; entire landscapes were transformed. Forests spread across the steppelands, displacing the large animal species, such as mammoths and bison, that had grazed there.

msgid "By 10,000 BCE foragers had migrated to most parts of this region, and in some areas there was simply not enough room for them all to settle. With each group having to survive off smaller and smaller parcels of land, these communities found themselves caught in what big historian David Christian has called the “trap of sedentism.” Traditional foraging lifeways are almost always nomadic, requiring near constant migration, so human communities had to keep populations small. It is impossible for migrating bands to support too many feeding infants or less mobile elderly members. Survival necessitated not only natural birth control but also killing off unwanted infants and the elderly to keep populations sustainable."

msgid "Evidence for the Natufian culture first came to light in 1928 with discoveries made in northern Israel by Dorothy Garrod at a place called Wadi en-Natuf (hence the name Natufian — we have no idea what they called themselves). We do know that they lived in villages, harvested wild grains, and hunted gazelles. The Natufian toolkit was not really any more sophisticated than that of other foragers, but their more intense use of stone sickle blades to harvest large quantities of wild cereal grains is evidence of a serious change in food-gathering practices. The grain they harvested was also subject to much higher levels of processing than ever before. Many Natufian sites show that standard mortars and grinding stones were supplemented by much larger pipe-shaped mortars dug deep into the bedrock."

Skeletal remains showed that most of the residents had suffered from rotten teeth as a result of eating too much barley and wheat. Ain Mallaha also shows that affluent foraging was leading to increasing populations. Although the site’s estimated year-round population of 200–300 people might seem tiny by today’s standards, this may well have been one of the largest human communities that had ever existed up to that time. This tells us that one of the most important impacts of affluent foraging is that population pressure was forcing humans into smaller territories and denser settlements."

This essay explores the idea that the history of a place is just as much about its physical environment as it is about superior technology or government. Big historians, who are interested in the appearance and development of the first agrarian civilizations, ask probing questions: What were the geographical and biological advantages favoring certain regions that facilitated the appearance of the first towns and cities there? What role did climate play in allowing for agrarian civilizations to appear in some regions, while others remained better suited for foraging? And why is it that, while some agrarian civilizations seem to have abused their environments, and thus sowed the seeds of their own destruction, others were able to husband the advantages provided by geography and biology and successfully sustain themselves for thousands of years?"

Older members of the community did not have to be abandoned; more children could be supported. As a result, affluent foraging groups began to increase in size, and this led to the problem of overpopulation. This is, in fact, what we find at most Natufian sites — clear evidence of population pressure. Eventually there were simply too many mouths to feed by foraging practices, which is what archaeologists have found at the site of Ain Ghazal on the outskirts of Amman, Jordan — a rapid fourfold increase in population around 9,000 years ago."

msgid "The history of Jericho is rich and complex, punctuated with the same parade of triumphs and tragedies that so many other ancient cities have experienced. But Jericho’s status as the most ancient city on Earth makes it unique. This longevity strongly supports the idea that history is ultimately as much about the physical environment in which it takes place as it is about technology or leadership. At the end of the last ice age the Fertile Crescent was favored with an array of natural advantages, which explains not only the emergence of agriculture but also that of the first villages, towns, and cities. These same advantages of geography, flora, fauna, and climate made it possible for the Natufians to establish a small foraging community deep in the tectonic fault of the Jordan Rift Valley, surrounded by natural defensive walls, and blessed with rich soil and a seemingly endless supply of fresh water, that easily transitioned into a thriving agricultural community."

But cities and states emerged only in a handful of regions that possessed enough favorable environmental factors to allow for the establishment of these large communities. Rather than thinking of the emergence of cities and states as an inevitable outcome, we need to focus on the particular natural reasons that allowed some villages to continue to grow until they became towns and cities."

Others had access to a critical resource, such as a reliable water supply. Yet others became important commercial centers because they controlled the trade in valuable goods, or they occupied a strategic site on important migration routes. Jericho has proven itself remarkably sustainable because it benefited from several of these advantages, most importantly a very favorable environment."

msgid "These changes were especially notable in the Fertile Crescent, an arc of high ground that stretches north up the coast of the eastern Mediterranean, east through the mountains of Turkey and northern Iraq, and then south along the high ground between Iraq and Iran. All across the Fertile Crescent, the change in climate encouraged the spread of small game and warmth- loving cereal grasses. Abundance was particularly great in regions where there were good supplies of water, of course, and also where the local environment had produced a range of plants and animals that were good potential domesticates. These same locations attracted humans, too, and we have evidence of numerous Stone Age foraging communities that were experimenting with these plants and animals. The most important of the groups attracted to the abundance of the Fertile Crescent was the Natufians."

The result at Ain Ghazal and so many other sites was that groups were forced to leave the settlement to try and survive elsewhere. At a handful of more sustainable sites, however, agriculture did prove capable of supporting much larger populations, once the inhabitants learned to domesticate certain plant and animal species and increase their production through full-scale farming. One such site was Jericho."

Every single human, wherever they lived, survived by foraging, also known as hunting and gathering. Humans had invented a wide array of foraging techniques specifically adapted to different environments, which ranged from the deserts of Australia to the Arctic ice. But the small size of most foraging bands, and the fact that few exchanges took place between them, limited the amount of collective learning that went on."

These processes led to an entirely new level of complexity in the human condition. The transition to agriculture was the first step in a cultural revolution that utterly transformed human societies and drove our species onto a path that led rapidly toward the astonishing complexity of the modern world.

msgid "About 245 million years ago, when all the continents on Earth were fused into one continent called Pangaea, North and South America were more closely packed together. The current shape of Mesoamerica (Middle America) began to emerge as Pangaea broke up, and North and South America separated, not to be rejoined again until about 3 million years ago. This reconnection happened as two tectonic plates moved against each other, causing volcanoes to erupt, which created islands. Sediment gradually filled in among the islands. This had an enormous impact on Earth’s climate, because it reconfigured the ocean currents. Since the Atlantic current could no longer flow into the Pacific Ocean, it turned north up the coast of North America and over to Europe, carrying warm water from the Caribbean that raised temperatures in Europe."

msgid "As a result of these factors, states and civilizations arose somewhat later in the Americas than they did in Afro-Eurasia. Once American civilizations emerged, they were not able to connect with each other, share their innovations, or learn collectively to the same extent as their counterparts in Afro-Eurasia. The civilizations created were similar in all their basic characteristics to those in Afro-Eurasia and seemed likely to continue their development if they had not been prematurely cut down by Europeans."

This area, around the curve of the Gulf of Mexico on the Yucatán Peninsula and south into present-day Guatemala, had poor, infertile soil and no large rivers, not what one would expect for a flourishing civilization. Yet its people built terraces to trap silt from the small rivers and grew corn, beans, squash, peppers, cassava (manioc root), and cacao (chocolate). With no beasts of burden, their luxury goods were portable by humans — feathers, jade, gold, and shells."

Historians debate the possible causes of the change — civil revolts, invasions, erosion, earthquakes, disease, drought.

They also received 2 million cotton cloaks, as well as jewelry, obsidian knives, rubber balls, jaguar skins, parrot feathers, jade, emeralds, seashells, vanilla beans, and chocolate. Without money, everyone was paid in food and goods. Their population had grown to at least 200,000–300,000 in the capital, several times the size of the contemporary London of King Henry VIII."

Not as much as in Afro-Eurasia, which stretched out east to west so that people could travel at approximately the same latitude (the distance from the equator) in similar climates. The Americas stretched north and south, with huge changes in climate. Crops could not be carried or exchanged because they would not grow at different latitudes without time to adapt. Americans built large canoes but not sailing vessels, and they stayed close to the shore and in calm waters. They made north-south connections, but these were less frequent than the east-west connections of Afro-Eurasia."

Within 10 years the Spanish controlled all of Mexico, easily overwhelming the traumatized survivors of the overwhelming disease."

msgid "In South America, civilization developed along the lengthy coastline on the western side of the continent. Plate tectonics formed a unique landscape with high mountains near the ocean as the Nazca plate slid beneath the South American plate. Early states developed along the coastline, but they could not overcome the frequent floods, earthquakes, and torrential rains to continue their development and grow their populations. Finally, in the 15th century, the Incas built a state high in the mountains with its capital at Cuzco, at 13,000 feet. At its height the Inca Empire controlled 10–11 million people, covering lands from present-day Quito, Ecuador, all the way to Santiago, Chile. Strikingly, this civilization had no written language; it used knots tied into ropes as a system of writing called _quipu_. But smallpox spread to this area even before the Spanish soldiers arrived, and by 1527 the Spanish conquistadors under Francisco Pizzaro had used their technological advantage to conquer a vast Inca civilization compromised by disease."

The Maya believed that the gods set the Sun burning by sacrificing themselves to start it. Since they believed that the Sun’s energy would continue only with the life-giving energy found in human blood to replenish it, they practiced ritual bloodletting achieved by using cactus or bone spines to pierce their earlobes, hands, or penises.

Its site was in the highlands of Mexico, more than a mile (some two kilometers) above sea level, in a place where water flowing from surrounding mountains created several large lakes. Teotihuacán began as an agricultural village located about 31 miles (50 kilometers) north of present-day Mexico City, but by the beginning of the Common Era it had grown to some 50,000 inhabitants. By 500 CE it had an estimated 100,000–200,000 people, to rank as one of the six largest cities in the world. Not much is understood about its government; its art portrays deities rather than royalty. Its people expanded Olmec graphic symbols, but all its books were destroyed about 750 CE, when it seems that unknown invaders burned the city and reduced its population to a quarter of its former numbers."

msgid "Most historians believe that the difference in disease immunity made the biggest impact when the people of the two hemispheres connected in 1492\\. Many common diseases in Afro-Eurasia — measles, smallpox, influenza, diphtheria, and bubonic plague — had originated in domestic animals and then passed to humans, who are closely enough related that some of the same bacteria and viruses are harmful. Since Afro-Eurasians had frequent contact with domestic animals, they developed some immunity to the diseases by being exposed to mild forms of the dangerous microorganisms as children. Disease exchanges along the Silk Roads spread these immunities. This could not happen in the Americas without domestic animals; when Africans and Europeans brought these “bugs” to the Americas, plus malaria and yellow fever from tropical Africa, wholesale disease and death overtook the Americans."

Instead of wild grains, goats, and sheep, people in the highlands of Mexico had corn (sometimes called maize), beans, peppers, tomatoes, and squash as their staple foods. The ancestor of modern corn, called “teosinte,” has cobs about the size of a human thumb.

For example, Americans did not use wheels (except the Maya, who put them on toys!), probably because they had no large domestic animals to pull wheeled devices. Americans did not melt iron or steel; they used obsidian (glassy volcanic rock that can be sharpened to a thinness of one molecule) for blades. They had no swords or guns. They had no horses, which had evolved in the Americas but which had gone extinct at the end of the last ice age, about when humans were arriving in the Americas."

msgid "The Aztecs adopted traditions that dated back to the Olmecs. They played the same ball game and kept a sophisticated calendar. They adopted traditional religious beliefs, holding that the gods had set the world in motion by their individual acts of sacrifice. Priests practiced bloodletting on themselves and believed that ritual sacrifice of humans was essential to prevent the destruction of the Fifth Sun by earthquakes or famine. The god of war, Huitzilopochli (we-tsee-loh-POCK-tlee), came to be the prevailing god in Tenochtitlan, and his priests placed more emphasis on human sacrifice than did earlier traditions. Priests laid the victims — mostly captives of war — over a curved stone high on a pyramid and cut open the chest with an obsid- ian blade to fling the still-beating heart into a ceremonial basin, while the desired blood flowed down the pyramid."

(This also applied to women who died in childbirth with their first child.) Priests also ranked among the elite.

msgid "[[☃ image 1]]Maya shaman/priests worked out remarkable systems of cosmology and mathematics. They devised three kinds of calendars. A calendar of the solar year of 365 days governed the agricultural cycle and a calendar of the ritual year of 260 days dictated daily affairs; these two calendars coincided every 52 years. A third calendar, called the Long Count calendar, extended back to the date August 13, 3114 BCE (on the Gregorian calendar), to record the large-scale passage of time. The Maya calculated a solar year as 365.242 days, about 17 seconds shorter than the figures of modern astronomers. They also introduced the concept of zero; the first evidence of zero as a number dates from 357 BCE, but it may go back further, to Olmec times. In Afro-Eurasia, Hindu scholars first represented zero in the 800s CE."

msgid "[[☃ image 1]]The founding culture of Mesoamerica appeared along the southwestern curve of the Gulf of Mexico, near the present city of Veracruz. This culture emerged in a series of river valleys, as Uruk did in Mesopotamia. Called the Olmecs (the “rubber people”), this culture lasted from about 1400 BCE to 100 BCE. It produced nearly imperishable art, notably large carved heads of volcanic rock, the largest weighing some 20 tons and standing about 10 feet tall. Monumental sculptures or tombs are typically indicative of a civilization with powerful leaders, but this culture probably ranks more as a chiefdom than as a state with extensive coercive power. The last Olmec site, Tres Zapotes, declined by about 100 BCE for unknown reasons. Was it volcanic eruptions? A shift in the flow of rivers? Scholars believe that the Olmecs may have deliberately destroyed their capital. Was there civil unrest? Class strife? No one knows."

"> When at last they arrived, Gilgamesh said to Urshanabi [the boatman], “This is the wall of Uruk, which no city on earth can equal. See how its ramparts gleam like copper in the sun. Climb the stone staircase, more ancient than the mind can imagine, approach the Eanna Temple, sacred to Ishtar, a temple that no king has equaled in size or beauty, walk on the wall of Uruk, follow its course around the city, inspect its mighty foundations, examine its brickwork, how masterfully it is built, observe the land it encloses: the palm trees, the gardens, the orchards, the glorious palaces and temples, the shops and marketplaces, the houses, the public squares.\n"

msgid "A great deal is known about Uruk because of excavations of the site beginning in 1850 and because the earliest writing in the world comes from there, dated to about 3500 BCE. People in Uruk wrote on clay tablets with reeds. The writing is called “cuneiform,” named after the wedge-shaped reeds that writers pressed into wet clay. Since clay tablets are more durable than the silk, bark, bamboo, or papyrus used by other people for writing, many of Uruk’s tablets have survived and are now held in museums throughout the world."

msgid "As a single authoritarian ruler emerged to lead Uruk and its surrounding farms and villages, historians say that the first state emerged almost simultaneously with the first city. The state consisted of powerful elites who could coerce labor and tribute. Why did the majority of people allow a few people so much power? This is difficult to answer, but on the one hand it seems that the elites took power as more resources became available. On the other hand, it seems that citizens gave power in exchange for organization, which permitted large-scale projects like irrigation, and for security and protection. What may have begun as consensual power may have evolved into coercive power as elites accumulated more resources."

What is a city? By “city” we mean simply a large group of people, tens of thousands, collected into a whole and living in a defined place with structures designated for a range of specific social functions. To support a city, people living on the land around it had to be able to generate stable surpluses of food from the fertility of the soil and the creatures that inhabited it. In addition, people in the city had to devise ingenious ways to distribute those surpluses, ways that would reinforce constructive patterns of conduct and practice."

msgid "Despite all the amazing innovations by its people, Uruk faced eventual decline. After Mesopotamia experienced several hundred years of constant warfare, Sargon of Akkad (ruled 2334–2279 BCE) conquered most of it. A serious drought occurred in about 2250 BCE. By 1700 BCE all of southern Mesopotamia had declined into a backwater of other empires. The underlying reasons seem to be environmental. The irrigation that Mesopotamians used to increase their crop yields increased the salinity, or salt content, of the soil. (As the sun evaporated the water standing in the fields, it left the mineral salts that had been dissolved in the water.) As the salinity of the soil increased, the yields of grain, especially of wheat, decreased gradually. By 1700 BCE crops were depleted by as much as 65 percent."

It began with pictures made in wet clay representing the various goods. After about 400 years people had figured out how to use symbols and abstract numbers instead of drawing a picture for each item. They used a small wedge to represent one, a small circle to represent 10, a large wedge for 600, and a large circle for 3,600\\. Their system of numbers was based partly on 10 and partly on 60 for measuring grain. This latter base-60, or “sexagesimal,” system led to viewing a circle as 360 degrees."

msgid "[[☃ image 1]]As people migrated into the two river valleys, they found that the soil produced abundant crops due to the fertility of topsoil from repeated flooding of the rivers. They could grow enough to store surplus grain, enough to support other individuals with occupations other than farming. The surplus grain needed to be collected and distributed; probably priests first managed this task. In addition to grains and domestic animals, people had plenty of fish and fowl from the river and marshes. Beer had already been invented, and a goddess of beer, named Ninkasi, was worshipped."

"> Just as the chains of interdependency in the case of pre-state societies are comparatively short, so their members’ experience of past and future as distinct from the present is less developed. In people’s experience, the immediate present — that which is here and now — stands out more sharply than either past or future. Human actions, too, tend to be more highly centred on present needs and impulses. In later societies, on the other hand, past, present and future are more sharply distinguished. The need and the capacity to foresee, and thus considerations of a relatively distant future, gain stronger and stronger influence on all activities to be undertaken here and now.\n"

"> Professor Movius and I stood on the shelf looking across the valley as the sun went slowly down behind the hills far to the right, sinking as a great red disc. As it was going down, the first crescent of the new moon appeared in the sky as a thin silver arc, facing the sinking sun. It was instantly apparent that the Les Eyzies horizon formed a perfect natural “calendar” and that the first crescent would appear over those hills at sunset every 29 or 30 days...that the sun was sinking at its farthest point north on that horizon, its position at summer solstice, and that it would now begin to move south.... The visual effect of the silver first crescent, aiming its arc at the setting sun and following the summer sun down, was stark and dramatic. There was no way that generations of hunters living on that shelf over a period of 18,000 years or more could fail to notice these periodic changes and movements of the sun and moon.... It took the next 18 years, however, before I could properly put together the seasonal and ecological dynamics of that valley and work out its relations to the art, images, and paintings in the caves.\n"

msgid "Agricultural societies began to appear from about 11,000 years ago. As they expanded and linked up with their neighbors they needed new and more reliable methods of keeping time. If you wanted to sell some produce in a nearby town or worship at a nearby temple you had to know exactly when the markets and religious rituals were held — and you needed to know in advance. Drifting in a week or two later no longer cut it, so you needed calendars that everyone agreed on and shared. If your village depended on irrigation, everyone needed to know exactly when the irrigation gates would be opened. Similarly, seeds were sown at particular times, and the harvest collected according to seasonal calendars based on Earth’s orbit around the Sun and associated climate patterns. And if you were sowing or harvesting alongside your neighbors, you all needed to agree exactly when to start."

The first workable method of radiometric dating, devised by American chemist Willard Libby in the early 1950s, used the breakdown of an isotope of carbon, C14, to date materials containing carbon. Since then, a whole range of new dating techniques have been developed, and they can now give us reasonably accurate dates for events reaching back to the Big Bang, 13.8 billion years ago."

With so many passengers and important cargo relying on transportation lines, on-time departures, connections, and arrivals were critical to the whole network. The first English train timetable was published in 1839 and, for the first time, different British cities needed to coordinate their clocks to the same national clock, that of Greenwich Mean Time (GMT), the time at the Royal Observatory. But not until 1880 was Greenwich Mean Time adopted officially throughout Britain. In the United States, regional time zones were not systematized until 1918\\.

msgid "Meetings with other communities were often seasonal and didn’t require great scheduling precision. If a group normally met with a neighboring tribe “when the reindeer returned” or “after the burdock went to seed,” it didn’t really matter if their schedules were a few days off. Foraging societies were much more forgiving about appointments than most modern city dwellers."

msgid "More elaborate instruments were used to track the movements of the stars and planets. It is possible that Stonehenge in England, which was constructed between 4,000 and 5,000 years ago, was designed partly to determine the exact dates of the summer and winter solstices (the days when the Sun reached its highest and lowest points in the sky). The most elaborate and precise of all agrarian-era calendars were probably those of Mesoamerica, which appeared in the first millennium BCE. The Maya calendars, for example, included a 260-day cycle based on biweekly rituals and a 365-day version organized around the agricultural and solar phases. They also had a “long-count” calendar measuring time from the beginning of their civilization. Meanwhile, the Romans developed a calendar with 10 months, and the names they used are mostly familiar (for example, Martius is our March). Eventually, they refined their calendar, adding two more months and even including the concept of a leap day."

msgid "Precise clocks were particularly important for navigators, who needed them to calculate their longitude, or how far west or east they had traveled. Once ships began to travel around the globe, from the late 15th century, the need for accurate timekeeping was well-recognized. Indeed, the British Royal Observatory at Greenwich was commissioned in 1675 to help solve this problem. In 1714 the British government offered a prize of \\£20,000 (nearly \\$5 million in today’s equivalent) for the first person to build a clock that could stay accurate to within two minutes during long ocean voyages. Yorkshire-born carpenter and clockmaker John Harrison spent most of his life on the task and was finally awarded the prize in 1773, three years before he died."

msgid "So no special instruments were required for timekeeping. But there are clues that even Paleolithic foragers didn’t rely entirely on their memories and their senses to keep track of time. In South Africa’s Blombos Cave, which was occupied perhaps as early as 100,000 years ago, archaeologists have found chunks of ochre with strange marks on them dating to about 70,000 years ago. These are the oldest known “artworks,” and, though most archaeologists are cautious about interpreting them, it’s tempting to think that the engravings were used to mark the passing of time. Perhaps they were lists of lunar cycles or dates of important rituals. More serious — if not universally accepted — evidence of calendars of some kind comes from about 40,000 years later. The American archaeologist Alexander Marshack (1918–2004) became fascinated by marks on Paleolithic objects, and argued that some of them should be regarded as calendars because they seem to have been tracking the movements of the Moon. In a 1984 lecture at New York’s Museum of Natural History, Marshack talked of his first visit (c. July 1964) to Les Eyzies, a prehistoric site in southwest France:"

msgid "This is why new devices began to appear that could track time more precisely. One method of timekeeping was to watch the Sun’s shadow using sundials. A stick in the ground would often do the job (as long as the Sun was shining!), but some sundials were extremely precise. Time was also measured by how long it took sand to move through a narrow hole in a glass container or by the rate at which water dripped from an urn."

With so many passengers and important cargo relying on transportation lines, on-time departures, connections, and arrivals were critical to the whole network. The first English train timetable was published in 1839 and, for the first time, different British cities needed to coordinate their clocks to the same national clock, that of Greenwich Mean Time (GMT), the time at the Royal Observatory. But not until 1880 was Greenwich Mean Time adopted officially throughout Britain. In the United States, regional time zones were not systematized until 1918\\. At about the same time, the idea of daylight saving was introduced in numerous countries around the world."

In Threshold 7, it is important and interesting to know that even though agriculture is thousands of years old, there are still many unanswered questions about how and why people began to farm. This activity will allow you to investigate new research on agriculture including how scientists and historians are using techniques like DNA testing to determine plant and animal origins."

msgid "In addition, the sheer number of possible exchanges increases very quickly as the number of people rises. How many possible links are there between three friends? The answer is three. Between four friends? The answer is not four; it is six. You can see this by drawing lines between four points. How many links are there between five friends? The answer is 10\\. We can calculate the relationship between nodes and edges precisely using a mathematical formula but the main trend is that, as groups get larger, the number of possible links within the network increases _much_ faster than does the number of people. So in large groups, the possibilities for sharing information are much greater than in small groups."

If you are a king, you have scribes and priests and spies who can store large amounts of information for you and carry out your orders.

Different types of specialists acquired different skills and different types of information. Merchants, for example, had to learn about costs and prices in foreign countries; soldiers had to learn about weaponry and tactics; priests had to learn about religious traditions and rituals. The total amount of available information increased rapidly with the development of a division of labor."

msgid "Agriculture came later to the Americas but it's important to note that it emerged completely independent of the farming that had already begun on the Asian continent. The rising seas had covered the Bering Land Bridge thousands of years before and humans in the Americas developed agriculture on their own, without contact with humans living in Afro-Eurasia. At about this same time or earlier, agriculture also emerged in the highlands of Papua New Guinea in the Pacific region. Farmers in the Americas cultivated a wild cereal grass called teosinte in Mesoamerica and grew potatoes in the Andes Mountains while farmers in Papua New Guinea grew sugar cane and tubers like taro and yam."

The first \"farming\" was thought to have occurred near Jericho in the West Bank region of present-day Israel and Jordan by a group of people called the Natufians, but full-scale agriculture really took off a bit later in Mesopotamia – a region between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers in present-day Iraq.

Under its Greek rulers, Alexandria cultivated a famous library that attracted many scholars from Greece, and its school for astronomers received generous patronage. After the Romans conquered Egypt in 30 BCE (when Octavian defeated Cleopatra), Alexandria became the second-largest city in the Roman Empire and a major source of Rome’s grain, but less funding was provided for scientific study of the stars. Ptolemy was the only great astronomer of Roman Alexandria."

msgid "This idea of the Universe did not fit exactly with all of Ptolemy’s observations. He was aware that the size, motion, and brightness of the planets varied. So he incorporated Hipparchus’s notion of epicycles, put forth a few centuries earlier, to work out his calculations. Epicycles were small circular orbits around imaginary centers on which the planets were said to move while making a revolution around the Earth. By using Ptolemy’s tables, astronomers could accurately predict eclipses and the positions of planets. Because real visible events in the sky seemed to confirm the truth of Ptolemy’s views, his ideas were accepted for centuries until the Polish astronomer, Copernicus, proposed in 1543 that the Sun, rather than the Earth, belonged in the center."

msgid "Building on the work of Vesto Slipher, who measured the redshifts associated with galaxies more than a decade earlier, Hubble and his assistant, Milton Humason, discovered a rough proportionality between the distances and redshifts of 46 galaxies they studied. By 1929 they had formulated what became known as Hubble’s Law. Hubble’s Law basically states that the greater the distance of a galaxy from ours, the faster it recedes. It was proof that the Universe is expanding."

In 1923 he spotted a Cepheid variable star in what was known as the Andromeda Nebula. Using Leavitt’s techniques, he was able to show that Andromeda was nearly 1 million light years away and clearly a galaxy in its own right, not a gas cloud."

In 1587 he got a position teaching mathematics at the University of Pisa, which paid him a very modest salary. Two years later Galileo’s father died, leaving Galileo responsible for the promised dowries of his two sisters. The next year he secured the chair of mathematics at the renowned University of Padua, and the new position paid three times as much. In addition to mathematics, Galileo gave private instruction in military architecture, fortification, surveying, and mechanics."

msgid "At the age of 31 Galileo showed his first interest in astronomy, while working to explain the cause of the tides. (Padua was 20 miles inland from Venice, an important trading port on the Adriatic Sea.) Astronomy was considered part of mathematics at the time, while cosmology was part of philosophy. Most scholars still held the views of Ptolemy, who followed Aristotle in thinking that all heavenly bodies revolve around Earth (a geocentric model). But other views were being considered, including that of Copernicus, who claimed that all bodies revolve around the Sun (a heliocentric model), and of Danish astronomer Tycho Brahe, who held that Earth was fixed but other planets are in orbit around the Sun."

msgid "In 1597 a German visitor gave Galileo a book by German astronomer Johannes Kepler, who was enthusiastically pro-Copernicus. Galileo wrote a letter to Kepler stating that he had long agreed with Copernicus but that he had not dared to make his thoughts public because he was frightened that he would become, like Copernicus, “mocked and hooted by an infinite multitude.” In the same year Galileo invented a mechanical device for mathematical calculations. He had a craftsman make them, so that Galileo could sell them and give classes on how to use them."

msgid "In 1613 Galileo published his _Letters on Sunspots_, based on his observations of the dark spots on the Sun that are caused by intense magnetic activity. In an appendix he noted that he agreed with Copernicus, mentioning the fact that he had seen eclipses of the satellites of Jupiter, further evidence that they orbited the planet. This is the only time that Galileo expressed in print his support of the Copernican model. Galileo had no definitive evidence that Copernicus was right, and he didn’t claim that he did. Galileo’s main pieces of evidence were the phases of Venus, the eclipses of Jupiter’s moons, the existence of tides (which Galileo believed could only occur if the Earth moved), observable planetary speeds, and the distances of planets from the Sun."

Galileo traveled to Rome to try to prevent this; he thought it was a mistake that would eventually tarnish the church’s reputation. He believed that the Catholic Church should keep science and religion completely separate and not interfere with scientific research. The Church upheld their position and Galileo agreed to obey the ban."

msgid "In 1623 a Florentine who admired Galileo became Pope Urban VIII. Galileo had six audiences (meetings) with the Pope in 1624 and received permission to publish his theory on the causes of tides, provided he did not take sides on the cosmological debate. For the next six years Galileo worked on this book, which turned into a dialogue concerning the relative merits of the Ptolemaic and the Copernican conceptions of the Universe, without reaching a conclusion of one over the other. To carry out the discussion, Galileo invented three characters: Salviati, who gave Copernicus’s views; Simplicio, who presented Aristotelian/Ptolemaic views; and Sagredo, an interested layman. Simplicio was named for an ancient Greek commentator on Aristotle. The title in English was _Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems–Ptolemaic and Copernican._"

msgid "When Galileo was 10, his family moved to Florence, northeast of Rome, where he was educated in a monastery. He was attracted to the priesthood, but his father steered him to study medicine from 1581 to 1585 at the University of Pisa, some 40 miles west of Florence on the coast, and very near Galileo’s childhood home. University studies at that time were based primarily on Aristotle’s philosophy, but Galileo’s acute observations caused him to question some of these accepted views. He noticed that hailstones of different sizes reached the ground simultaneously, contradicting Aristotle’s rule that bodies fall with speeds proportional to their size. At this time Galileo also sat in on lectures by a practical mathematician in the service of the Grand Duke, apart from his university studies."

Rather than playing after school with the other boys, Newton spent his free time making wooden models, kites of various designs, sundials, even a water clock. When his mother, who was hardly literate, took him out of school at 15 to turn him into a farmer, the headmaster, Henry Stokes, who recognized where Newton’s talents lay, prevailed on her to let Newton return to school and prepare for university."

msgid "Newton’s most important book was written in Latin; its title was translated as _Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy_ (1687). It proved to be one of the most influential works in the history of science. In its pages Newton asserted the three Laws of Motion, elaborated Johannes Kepler’s Laws of Motion, and stated the Law of Universal Gravitation. The book is primarily a mathematical work, in which Newton developed and applied calculus, the mathematics of change, which allowed him to understand the motion of celestial bodies. To reach his conclusions he also used accurate observations of planetary motion, which he made by designing and building a new kind of telescope, one that used mirrors to reflect, rather than lenses to refract, light."

msgid "This calculation proved powerful because it presented the Universe as an endless void filled with small material bodies moving according to harmoni- ous, rational principles. Newton understood gravity as a universal property of all bodies, its force dependent only on the amount of matter contained in each body. Everything, from apples to planets, obeys the same unchanging laws. By combining physics, mathematics, and astronomy, Newton made a giant leap in human understanding of Earth and the cosmos. Newton’s mathematical method for dealing with changing quantities is now called the calculus. Newton did not publish his method but solved problems using it. Later the German scientist Gottfried Wilhelm von Leibniz also worked out “the calculus”, and his notation proved easier to use. Newton accused Leibniz, in a nasty dispute, of stealing his ideas, but historians now believe that each invented the calculus independently."

msgid "At these universities, Copernicus began to question what he was taught. For example, his professors at Krakow taught about both Aristotle’s and Ptolemy’s views of the Universe. However, Copernicus became aware of the contradictions between Aristotle’s theory of the Earth, the Sun and the planets as a system of concentric spheres and Ptolemy’s use of eccentric orbits and epicycles. Even though his professors believed that the Earth was in the center of the Universe and it did not move, Copernicus began to question those ideas. While at the University of Padua, there is some evidence that he had already developed the idea of a new system of cosmology based on the movement of the Earth."

He omitted mathematical calculations for the sake of brevity, but he confidently asserted that the Earth both revolved on its axis and orbited around the Sun. This solved many of the problems he found with Ptolemy’s model, especially the lack of uniform circular motion."

The next bishop-prince worked persistently to force Copernicus to give up his companion. Lutheran Protestantism was springing up nearby, as cities, dukes, and kings renounced their loyalty to the Catholic Church. The Catholic Church responded by trying to enforce more obedience to its rules. However, Copernicus and Schilling managed to keep seeing each other, although not living together, until much later when she moved to the city of Gdansk."

He had resisted publishing it for fear of the ensuing controversy and out of hope for more data. Finally, in 1541, the 68-year-old Copernicus agreed to publication, supported by a mathematician friend, Georg Rheticus, a professor at the University of Wittenberg, in Germany. Rheticus had traveled to Warmia to work with Copernicus, and then took his manuscript to a printer in Nuremberg, Johannes Petreius, who was known for publishing books on science and mathematics. Copernicus gave his master work the Latin title De Revolutionibus Orbium Coelestium (translated to English as On the Revolutions of the Celestial Spheres)."

msgid "Due at least in part to the influence of his uncle, Copernicus was elected in 1497 a canon of the cathedral in Frombork (known as Frauenburg at the time), a town in Warmia on the Baltic Sea coast. Copernicus did not assume his position there until 1510, when he took a house outside the cathedral walls and an apartment inside a tower of the fortifications. He had many duties as canon, including mapmaking, collecting taxes and managing the money, serving as a secretary, and practicing medicine. He led a half-religious, half-secular life and still managed to continue his astronomical observations from his tower apartment. He conducted these with devices that looked like wooden yardsticks joined together, set up to measure the angular altitude of stars and planets and the angles between two distant bodies in the sky. He had a simple metal tube to look through, but no telescope had yet been invented."

Inside the fixed stars were Saturn, then Jupiter and Mars, then Earth, Venus, and Mercury, all in circular orbits around the Sun in the cen- ter. He calculated the time required for each planet to complete its orbit and was off by only a bit."

He was able to see and appreciate his accomplishment, and then closed his eyes and died peacefully, on May 24, 1543\\. Thus he avoided both scorn and praise."

He was in his first year at the university when Columbus sailed to a continent that was then unknown in Europe.

Nicolaus was born on February 19, 1473, in Torun, in the approximate center of what is now Poland. His father, named Nicolaus Koppernigk, was a copper merchant from Krakow, and his mother, Barbara Watzenrode, was the daughter of a wealthy Torun merchant. Nicolaus was the youngest of four children; he had a brother and two sisters. His father died when he was 10 and his mother at about the same time. His mother’s brother adopted Nicolaus and his siblings and secured the future of each of them."

msgid "By comparing thousands of photographic plates, Leavitt discovered a direct correlation between the time it takes for a Cepheid variable to go from bright to dim and back to bright, and how bright the star actually is (its “intrinsic brightness”). The longer the period of fluctuation, the brighter the star. This meant that even though a star might appear extremely dim, if it had a long period it must actually be extremely large; it appeared dim only because it was extremely far away. By calculating how bright it appeared from Earth and comparing this to its intrinsic brightness, one could estimate how much of the star’s light had been lost while reaching Earth, and how far away the star actually was."

msgid "Henrietta Swan Leavitt was born on July 4, 1868, in Lancaster, Massachusetts. Since her father was a Congregational minister, the family moved frequently. Henrietta was the eldest of seven children, two of whom died as toddlers. When Henrietta was about 14 the family moved to Cleveland, Ohio, and in 1885 Henrietta enrolled in Oberlin College to prepare for the strict entrance requirements of the college she really wanted to attend — the Society for Collegiate Instruction of Women, later known as Radcliffe College (now part of Harvard University), in Cambridge, Massachusetts. When she was 20, in 1888, Leavitt returned to Massachusetts, to Cambridge, where her uncle lived, and achieved her dream to enroll in the Society for Collegiate Instruction for Women. She became interested in astronomy when she took a course in it during her senior year. She graduated in 1892."

Using the Mount Wilson telescope and building on Leavitt’s work, Hubble located Cepheid variables so far away that they conclusively established the presence of other galaxies.

Above the Moon’s orbit the heavens seemed immune to change, novelty, and collapse. Their immutability pointed both minds and hearts toward a better and more permanent world than that which existed on Earth. Aristotle (384–322 BCE) had even portrayed the heavens as a “quintessential” (fifth) kind of reality far surpassing in value the four mundane elements (earth, air, fire, and water) that make up the sublunary world “down here.” In contrast to imperfect earthly things that change and eventually perish, the heavens seemed to mirror the changeless eternity of God."

However, prior to Galileo’s release of _The Starry Messenger_, Copernicus’s new model of the heavens seemed little more than an abstract mathematical scheme for making astronomical predictions. Those who read Copernicus’s work often took it simply as an experiment in thought rather than a realistic representation of the heavens and Earth. For Galileo, on the other hand, the Copernican system was not a mental exercise but an approximation of the way the heavens really do hang together."

Little did Galileo know, however, of the remarkably tight narrative connection that astronomy and astrophysics would eventually draw between the existence of life and the seemingly unchanging and impersonal heavens."

msgid "Modern astronomy, however, gradually robbed the heavens of their transparency to God — at least for many thoughtful people like Donne. Tycho Brahe (1546–1601), for example, demonstrated to his shocked contemporaries that comets and supernovae — both implying change and novelty — existed _beyond_, rather than beneath, the Moon’s orbit. Thus the superlunary heavenly vault showed itself to be imperfect after all and could no longer adequately represent the unchanging perfection of God. Johannes Kepler (1571–1630), moreover, calculated that planets move in “ugly” elliptical patterns rather than perfectly circular orbits. Careful new observations increasingly demonstrated that the heavens, like things on Earth, are ordinary after all."

However, he never thought of his observations and ideas as contrary to the basic teachings of his faith. For him science has little or nothing to do with theology. Nonetheless, the case of Galileo and the entire Copernican revolution, as Donne’s poem indicates, did have implications for human spirituality."

msgid "The “new philosophy” that Donne refers to — since there was no word for “science” at the time — is the Copernican revolution. In 1610, two years before Donne’s poem appeared, Galileo Galilei (1564–1642) had published the world’s first scientific bestseller, _The Starry Messenger_. This revolutionary work argued that the heavens are not organized the way astronomers, philosophers, and theologians had taught for ages. As far as Donne was concerned, however, Galileo’s ideas threatened not only the entrenched cosmology of Plato, Aristotle, and Ptolemy but also the religious sensibilities associated for centuries with an Earth-centered (geocentric) vision of nature."

msgid "Why is there such fierce resistance to science by so many religious believers? It is partly because faith, theology, and spirituality have always been closely tied to a particular age’s picture of the natural world. In biblical times, for example, the religious drama of salvation assumed a three-level picture of the cosmos: the heavens fixed firmly above; the Earth beneath; and then, lower still, the underworld (_Sheol_), the dwelling place of the dead. In the 17th century most religious believers took the biblical portrait of nature literally. Certain passages in the Bible insinuated that the Sun moves and the Earth stands still. Thus the Bible seemed to support the Ptolemaic picture of the Universe, while Copernican astronomy seemed to contradict God’s word."

The perfectly circular movement of heavenly bodies and the faultless spherical geometry of the Sun and Moon, for example, offered at least a hint of the infinite beauty that seemed to lie beyond our shadowy and perishable world."

"> In this essay, ‘normal science’ means research firmly based upon one or more past scientific achievements, achievements that some particular scientific community acknowledges for a time as supplying the foundation for its further practice. Today such achievements are recounted, though seldom in their original form, by science textbooks, elementary and advanced. These textbooks expound the body of accepted theory, illustrate many or all of its successful applications, and compare these applications with exemplary observations and experiments. Before such books became popular early in the nineteenth century (and until even more recently in the newly matured sciences), many of the famous classics of science fulfilled a similar function. Aristotle’s Physica, Ptolemy’s Almagest, Newton’s Principia and Opticks, Franklin’s Electricity, Lavoisier’s Chemistry, and Lyell’s Geology — these and many other works served for a time implicitly to define the legitimate problems and methods of a research field for succeeding generations of practitioners. They were able to do so because they shared two essential characteristics. Their achievement was sufficiently unprecedented to attract an enduring group of adherents away from competing modes of scientific activity. Simultaneously, it was sufficiently open-ended to leave all sorts of problems for the redefined group of practitioners to resolve.\n"
"> \n"
"> Achievements that share these two characteristics I shall henceforth refer to as ‘paradigms,’ a term that relates closely to ‘normal science.’ By choosing it, I mean to suggest that some accepted examples of actual scientific practice — examples which include law, theory, application, and instrumentation together — provide models from which spring particular coherent traditions of scientific research. These are the traditions which the historian describes under such rubrics as ‘Ptolemaic astronomy’ (or ‘Copernican’), ‘Aristotelian dynamics’ (or ‘Newtonian’),…and so on. The study of paradigms, including many that are far more specialized than those named illustratively above, is what mainly prepares the student for membership in the particular scientific community with which he will later practice. Because he there joins men who learned the bases of their field from the same concrete models, his subsequent practice will seldom evoke overt disagreement over fundamentals. Men whose research is based on shared paradigms are committed to the same rules and standards for scientific practice. That commitment and the apparent consensus[8] it produces are prerequisites for normal science, i.e., for the genesis[9] and continuation of a particular research tradition.\n"
"> \n"
"> History suggests that the road to a firm research consensus is extraordinarily arduous...\n"
"> \n"
"> History also suggests, however, some reasons for the difficulties encountered on that road. In the absence of a paradigm or some candidate for paradigm, all of the facts that could possibly pertain to the development of a given science are likely to seem equally relevant. As a result, early fact-gathering is a far more nearly random activity than the one that subsequent scientific development makes familiar. Furthermore, in the absence of a reason for seeking some particular form of more recondite[10]  information, early fact-gathering is usually restricted to the wealth of data that lie ready to hand…Because the…facts… could not have been casually discovered, technology has often played a vital role in the emergence of new sciences.\n"
"> \n"
"> …No natural history can be interpreted in the absence of at least some implicit body of intertwined theoretical and methodological belief that permits selection, evaluation, and criticism. If that body of belief is not already implicit in the collection of facts — in which case more than “mere facts” are at hand — it must be externally supplied…No wonder, then, that in the early stages of the development of any science different men confronting the same range of phenomena, but not usually all the same particular phenomena, describe and interpret them in different ways. What is surprising, and perhaps also unique in its degree to the fields we call science, is that such initial divergences should ever largely disappear.\n"
"> \n"
"> …To be accepted as a paradigm, a theory must seem better than its competitors, but it need not, and in fact never does, explain all the facts with which it can be confronted...\n"
"> \n"
"> …When, in the development of a natural science, an individual or group first produces a synthesis able to attract most of the next generation’s practitioners, the older schools gradually disappear. In part their disappearance is caused by their members’ conversion to the new paradigm. But there are always some men who cling to one or another of the older views, and they are simply read out of the profession, which there- after ignores their work. The new paradigm implies a new and more rigid definition of the field. Those unwilling or unable to accommodate their work to it must proceed in isolation or attach themselves to some other group. [I]t is sometimes just its reception of a paradigm that transforms a group previously interested merely in the study of nature into a profession or, at least, a discipline…\n"
"> \n"
"> When the individual scientist can take a paradigm for granted, he need no longer, in his major works, attempt to build his field anew, starting from first principles and justifying the use of each concept introduced. That can be left to the writer of textbooks…"

"> Normal science, the activity in which most scientists inevitably spend almost all their time, is predicated on the assumption that the scientific community knows what the world is like. Much of the success of the enterprise derives from the community’s willingness to defend that assumption, if necessary at considerable cost. Normal science, for example, often suppresses fundamental novelties[1] because they are necessarily subversive[2] of its basic commitments. Nevertheless, so long as those commitments retain an element of the arbitrary, the very nature of normal research ensures that novelty shall not be suppressed for very long. Sometimes a normal problem, one that ought to be solvable by known rules and procedures, resists the reiterated[3] onslaught[4] of the ablest members of the group within whose competence it falls.\n"
"> \n"
"> On other occasions a piece of equipment designed and constructed for the purpose of normal research fails to perform in the anticipated manner, revealing an anomaly that cannot, despite repeated effort, be aligned with professional expectation. In these and other ways besides, normal science repeatedly goes astray. And when it does — when, that is, the profession can no longer evade[5] anomalies that subvert[6] the existing tradition of scientific practice — then begin the extraordinary investigations that lead the profession at last to a new set of commitments, a new basis for the practice of science. The extraordinary episodes in which that shift of professional commitments occurs are the ones known in this essay as scientific revolutions. They are the tradition-shattering complements[7] to the tradition-bound activity of normal science.\n"
"> \n"
"> The most obvious examples of scientific revolutions are those famous episodes in scientific development that have often been labeled revolutions before...the major turning points in scientific development associated with the names of Copernicus, Newton, Lavoisier, and Einstein. More clearly than most other episodes in the history of at least the physical sciences, these display what all scientific revolutions are about. Each of them necessitated the community’s rejection of one time-honored scientific theory in favor of another incompatible with it. Each produced a consequent shift in the problems available for scientific scrutiny and in the standards by which the profession determined what should count as an admissible problem or as a legitimate problem-solution. And each transformed the scientific imagination in ways that we shall ultimately need to describe as a transformation of the world within which scientific work was done. Such changes, together with the controversies that almost always accompany them, are the defining characteristics of scientific revolutions."

msgid "[[☃ image 1]]Thomas  Kuhn (1922 – 1996) was an American historian and philosopher of science who began his career in theoretical physics before switching career paths. His book, _The Structure of Scientific Revolutions_, which was first published in 1962, is one of the most cited academic books of all time and made Kuhn perhaps the most influential philosopher of science in the twentieth century. His work challenged the prevailing view of progress in “normal science,” which was that science has been a continuous increase in a set of accepted facts and theories. He argued that, instead, the history of science has been episodic, with periods of continuity interrupted by revolutionary science during which a new “paradigm” changes the rules and direction of scientific research. His analysis of science, which called into question its objectivity, caused a firestorm of controversy and continues to inspire reaction and debate in and beyond scientific communities."

In expressing my admiration and in offering encouragement to these brave pioneers of scientific research, to whom humanity owes so much of its current development, I would urge them to continue their efforts without ever abandoning the sapiential horizon within which scientific and technological achievements are wedded to the philo- sophical and ethical values which are the distinctive and indelible mark of the human person."

msgid "A breakthrough came in the mid-nineteenth century with research conducted at the Roman College by Father Angelo Secchi. He was the first to classify stars according to their spectra, the color of light that stars emit. Modern spectroscopy is very important in astronomy today because scientists know that different elements have their own emission spec- tra, and can contribute to the “chemical signature” that a star’s light reveals."

His recantation, or confession, on June 22, 1633, “did not include two points because Galileo was opposed to them: that he was not a good Catholic and that he had deceived others by publishing his book” (p. 79)."

In 1542, the Church began the Inquisition, an organization that made decisions on questions of morality and faith. It analyzed books and individuals to determine if what they said agreed with the Bible. Some people were sentenced to death for airing their beliefs."

Pope Pius XI (papal reign 1922–1939) relocated the observatory to Castel Gandolfo and put it in the hands of Jesuits; three new telescopes were constructed, an astrophysical laboratory for spectral analysis of the light from distant celestial bodies was installed, and research programs began on Cepheid variables. A Schmidt wide-angle telescope, installed in 1957, allowed for further work on the classification of stars."

Galileo, who was born and educated in Pisa, first visited Rome in March 1611 to demonstrate the power of the telescope to church officials. He shared the observations he had made with Jesuit mathematicians and philosophers (Hilliam, 2005)."

The biennial summer program — which draws graduate students in astronomy and astrophysics from around the world — and and collaborations with other astronomical institutes had necessitated more space, according to Funes. The facility includes two floors in a renovated building on the grounds of the Pontifical Villas of Gandolfo, and has a library, conference room, offices, guest quarters, laboratory, and chapel (Vatican Observatory Newsletter, Fall 2009, p. 1). The unveiling took place in what was dubbed the “International Year of Astronomy,” which honored Galileo’s first scientific use of the telescope 400 years prior."

By proving that the comet was not in our atmosphere, he shattered the theory that the planets were nested around the Earth on crystalline spheres and laid the foundation for our modern understanding of an evolving cosmos. Brahe’s influence extended to one of his most famous students, Johannes Kepler, who used Brahe’s detailed observational record to develop his own Laws of Planetary Motion."

Using his own techniques, Brahe was able to prove that the new star (actually a supernova now known as SN 1572) was beyond the Moon, in the celestial realm — the supposedly unchanging backdrop of stars. The heavens had changed, and he had observed and recorded it for science."

All of the matter that formed Earth, all of the materials that formed the stars and galaxies that light up the night sky, all of the building blocks for everything in the Universe were once contained in a tiny singularity. Even space and time as we know them emerged from the Big Bang. That’s why the Big Bang is considered the first “new complexity” in the Universe and the first major threshold of increasing complexity in this course. Scientists, and all of us, are continuing to learn more about the Big Bang and how our Universe was formed."

They taught how to hunt, what seasons were best for particular foods, and what social rules would allow one to travel through a neighbor’s territory. As a result, each human gained access to knowledge that had been generated by previous generations, and each individual could add to that body of knowledge. Our species has a colossal amount of infor-mation about the world and, therefore, a lot of power. As the 18th-century writer Adam Ferguson put it, “In the human kind, the species has a progress as well as the individual; they build in every subsequent age on foundations formerly laid.”"

One possible answer: technologies such as stone tools! That’s exactly why Louis Leakey thought that we should regard _Homo habilis_ as humans. As early as 2 million years ago, they were making simple stone tools. But there’s a problem. Thanks to the work of Leakey’s protégé Jane Goodall and other primatologists, we now know that chimps can make tools; for example, they use twigs to get tasty termites out of termite mounds. In fact, lots of animals use tools, but none seem to accumulate new technologies over time as well as humans do."

msgid "Now we need to start thinking about how collective learning works in different periods of human history. The diagram opposite is a very simple map of the relations between three people (or perhaps three groups of people). We will use it to help us think about how humans exchange information and how these exchanges have shaped human history. You can imagine this as a map of information exchanges or collective learning between individuals in a few small communities of foragers."

As the use of small stone blades became widespread, we presume that these early humans knew how to use their sharp stone edges to shape wooden spears or digging sticks. We also know that foragers often used natural resins and fibers to carefully bind shaped blades to shafts, to form spears or arrows. Combine these ideas and you have a new technology: hafting."

msgid "At the same time chimpanzees often demonstrated mutual sharing, helping, and compassion. Mothers, children, and siblings developed deep ties, often assisting each other throughout their lifetimes. Older siblings adopted younger ones if a mother died, and would even adopt an orphan from another mother if it had no relative to protect it. Some mothers were more attentive and playful than others, and Goodall observed that their chimps grew up less depressed and aggressive than the chimps whose mothers were less attentive."

Her interest in animals led her to contact Louis Leakey, the famous seeker of hominine bones, who was then working in Africa. He promptly hired her as his secretary. Leakey had been looking for someone to study chimpanzees in the wild and, after he got to know Goodall, felt that she would be perfect. Leakey believed that a woman would be more patient than a man in the field and would be less likely to kindle the aggressions of male chimps.

By this time the data included acts of warfare, murder, brutality, and even cannibalism by her beloved chimpanzees, challenging her belief in their inherent goodness. For the first 10 years she had believed that they were “rather nicer than human beings,” but now she had to acknowledge that in certain circumstances, such as competition for food, sex, or territory, or under emotions of jealousy, fear, or revenge, their behavior proved as dark and troubling as that seen in humans."

But Goodall saw a chimp break off a twig, strip its bark, and insert it into a termite mound. When the chimp withdrew the twig, it was covered with delicious termites ready to be licked off. Since then, other researchers have observed chimpanzees using more than half a dozen tools for assorted purposes. Chimp societies across Africa vary in their use of tools. Other animals, including some birds and dolphins, are now known to use tools."

Sometimes Louis shot a gazelle for its meat. Prides of lions prowled their camps at night. Keeping the cars and trucks running in the wilderness proved a monumental task. On occasion the only water available came from watering holes where rhinoceroses wallowed; the soup, coffee, and tea would taste of rhino urine. African servants cooked and served their meals and washed their clothes."

msgid "Louis Leakey was convinced that humans had evolved from the apes, which he realized were fast losing their territory in Africa. They had never been studied in the wild, only in captivity. Since knowing more about them would provide insights into hominine behavior, Leakey took the initiative to raise funds for people chosen by him to study apes in their own habitat before it was too late. He looked for young women who could do this work. In 1960 he helped a young Jane Goodall begin her study of chimpanzees in the wild; later, Dian Fossey studied gorillas and Biruté Mary Galdikas studied orangutans."

About 20,000 years ago an earthquake drained the lake; after that, the river cut a deep gorge through the sediment of the old lake bed. The river sliced mostly through the shoreline of the lake, revealing the remains of people and other animals that had once gathered there. Almost 2 million years of history are exposed in the 25-mile-long main gorge and in a side gorge 15 miles long, a “layer cake of evolution,” as Virginia Morell, a biographer of the Leakeys, calls it."

msgid "[[☃ image 1]]Olduvai Gorge lies in the Great Rift Valley, a massive geological fault in the African plate. The fault line runs from the Red Sea southward through Ethiopia and Tanzania, down to the mouth of the Zambezi River, in Mozambique. Eventually this crack in the plate will deepen so much that the eastern piece of Africa will break off and move away. Mountains and volcanoes frame the edge of the Great Rift Valley. The volcanic eruptions produce ash, which easily buries and fossilizes bones, making this ideal territory for finding fossils. After being buried under layers of soil for millions of years, the fossils are moved upward as the Earth continues to shift."

msgid "​Louis Leakey was born and grew up in Kenya, in a tiny mission village nine miles from Nairobi, now the capital of Kenya but then a small village on the railroad to Lake Victoria, the source of the Nile River. Louis’s parents were missionaries from England. They hired English tutors for their children, but mostly Louis spent his childhood hunting and trapping with the local Kikuyu boys. Louis spoke Kikuyu as a native language and went through initiation rites with his Kikuyu peers. At the age of 13 Louis built his own house, as was Kikuyu custom. He also found some relics that he recognized as ancient hand axes, even though they were made of obsidian rather than flint, like the ones in Europe were. World War I prevented Louis from being sent to boarding school in England; he was 16 before he traveled to London to prepare for entrance to Cambridge University to become an archaeologist."

msgid "Climate and environment determined what life was like for any specific group of humans, but some generalizations apply to any group of foragers. They must have possessed a detailed knowledge of their environment. They must have had a large territory in which to forage, larger if they lived in harsh environmental conditions that provided fewer food resources and smaller if they had abundance. Most foragers lived by moving frequently and making temporary encampments. They might have repeated seasonal movements based on animal migrations or the ripening of different plant food sources. Foragers usually lived in small groups of 15 to 30, and split up further when food became scarce or when conflicts arose. Populations grew extremely slowly, if at all. Mothers’ milk provided the only sustenance for infants and nursing extended for three to four years, often preventing a new pregnancy. In any case, mothers could not carry more than one infant at a time. In these close-knit groups, foragers usually shared the food they accumulated, especially prizes of fresh meat. Apparently, foraging societies were the most egalitarian in human history."

msgid "Humans gradually developed their skill in hunting. At first hominines probably scavenged meat that had been killed by other animals. They could drag a carcass to a safe place and use their stone tools to butcher the flesh and crack the bones for marrow. As they developed better weapons and learned to hunt together, they were able to take down larger animals and to devise innovative ways for defeating multiple prey. Herding groups of animals over a cliff and retrieving the carcasses later is one example of this."

msgid "In addition, whenever humans migrated into new parts of the world, a wave of extinctions of other large animals occurred. In North and South America about 75 percent of the animals weighing more than 100 pounds went extinct within a couple of thousand years after humans arrived. These animals included mastodons, camels, horses, and saber-toothed tigers. In Australia, where humans are thought to have arrived about 40–60,000 years ago, similar extinctions occurred roughly 30,000 years ago. The rate of extinction was about 85 percent and included giant kangaroos and marsupial lions. In Eurasia the extinctions occurred more gradually and included mammoths, woolly rhinoceroses, and giant elk. While debate continues, it may be that a combination of changing climate, human hunting, and other changes brought about by humans may have done these large animals in."

As fruit trees in the rain forest became less abundant in the cooling, drying climate, the hominines who survived had to find other food sources. As they did, many traits evolved: walking on two feet (bipedalism), loss of most hair, smaller intestines, larger brains, and better communication. These are essentially the hallmarks of being human."

msgid "People who study foragers are archaeologists and anthropologists. Archaeologists examine human societies through material, cultural, and environmental data left behind. Their work encompasses human societies from the development of the first tools up to recent decades. Anthropologists study contemporary societies that still live much like preagricultural ones. Both types of study are challenging and open to varied interpretations. Conclusions about ancient foragers reached from studying modern foragers are especially tentative, since modern foragers cannot escape completely the world around them. Modern foraging communities often use contemporary tools and partially rely on fairly recent agricultural and technological advances. Their lands have also been greatly limited by development and the overall increase in global population."

For one thing, archaeologists have found evidence that foragers set fire to large areas of land. Presumably they did this to drive animals out for killing and to promote the growth of fresh plants that would attract animals and would provide food for gathering. Australian Aboriginal use of this practice was given the name “firestick farming.” These fires turned scrubland into grassland and suppressed some species, altering the environment."

For gathering, the women used a blanket, a sling made of hide, a cloak to carry wood and food, smaller carrying bags, and a digging stick about three feet long and about an inch in diameter. Nuts and roots provided the staple foods. Women also collected fruit, berries, bush onions, and ostrich eggs. Insects — grasshoppers, beetles, caterpillars, moths, butterflies, and termites — supplied a portion of the Bushmen’s protein.

Among many current foraging societies, men and women are flexible about who hunts small birds and animals, and, in some cultures, the hunting and gathering roles are exchanged.

Traditionally, foragers were viewed as backward “cavemen” with short, miserable lives, barely eking out an existence. In the 1960s, fieldwork done among surviving foragers (the Bushmen in Botswana, the Aboriginals in Australia, and the Yanomami in the Brazilian rain forest) revealed that foragers enjoy good nutrition obtained in a few hours a day, leaving plenty of time for socializing and grooming. By the 1980s this view was challenged, and no agreement has yet been reached."

Harvard paleontologist Stephen Jay Gould suggested that Teilhard might have been involved in perpetrating the Piltdown hoax, in which bones discovered in Sussex, England, were presented as the so-called “missing link” between humans and apes. (Teilhard made follow-up investigations at the site; the discovery was questioned by a colleague of Teilhard’s and definitively discredited in 1953, when radiometric dating showed the skull and jaw to have come from differing, not to mention relatively recent, times.)"

In this first basic vision we begin to see how the kingdom of God and cosmic love can be reconciled: the bosom of Mother Earth is, in some way, the bosom of God.” He concluded: “To live the cosmic life is to live with the dominating consciousness that each one of us is an atom of the mystical and cosmic body of Christ.”"

msgid "Teilhard challenged theologians to view their ideas in the perspective of evolution and challenged scientists to examine the ethical and spiritual implications of their knowledge. He fully affirmed cosmic and biological evolution and saw them as part of an even more encompassing spiritual evolution toward the goal of ultrahumans and complete divinity. This hypothesis still resonates for some as a way to place scientific fact within an overarching spiritual view of the cosmos, though most scientists today reject the notion that the Universe is moving toward some clear goal."

They were international best sellers and have been translated into 22 languages. In late 1957 the Holy Office withdrew Teilhard’s books from seminary libraries and ordered they not be sold in Catholic bookstores. In 1962 the Vatican claimed that Teilhard’s books contained “such ambiguities and indeed even serious errors, as to offend Catholic doctrine,” without indicating what the errors were."

In 1991, archaeologists began to excavate a wealth of artifacts that gave them new information about the early humans who had lived in the cave off and on starting about 100,000 years ago. Scientists have used the tools, fossils, paintings, and other clues found at Blombos to learn a great deal about the lives of early humans."

msgid "[[☃ image 1]]Credit cards are one of the most common forms of payment today. Individuals and companies using cards are able to make or receive payments without exchanging actual money. The cards link transaction amounts to certain identities. Individuals and businesses are responsible for covering their charges while the merchants receive payment from the cardholders' banks. The banks who issue credit cards calculate exchange rates when a transaction involves currencies from different nations. Often, credit card users pay fees and incur interest when they let purchases accumulate or when they borrow money “against” their card. The earliest forms of credit cards were introduced in the early 1900s as a way to secure customer loyalty. These cards were only accepted at the businesses that issued them. It wasn't until 1950 that the Diners Club Card became the first modern, multi-use \"charge card.\""

The earliest example is thought to have depicted a lion and a sunburst, symbols of Lydia’s then-king. In time, standards for weight and purity were set, and the currency made its way into mainland cities in ancient Greece. Eventually electrum went out of style as coins of gold or silver became the predominant means of exchange."

msgid "[[☃ image 1]]Numerous civilizations around the world have valued shells, and some have made them a form of money. Indigenous people in eastern North America prized the purple and white beads made from whelk and quahog shells, called wampum. The cylindrical beads were originally strung into necklaces and belts and used for recordkeeping. By the time European colonists arrived in the Americas, wampum had evolved into an important unit of exchange among tribes. Realizing their value, colonists began to mass produce the beads to use for trading with the Native Americans. The beads actually gained stature as a substitute for coins in mid-17th century New England but wampum’s lack of inherent value eventually doomed it as a currency. Another type of shells, cowrie, were used as currency in parts of Asia and western Africa until the middle of the 19th century."

msgid "[[☃ image 1]]On the isolated Pacific islands of Yap (in Micronesia), a currency developed that was based on wheels of limestone. As the material was not available on the Yap Islands, Yapese had to bring it over from quarries in Palau, an island chain hundreds of miles of away. Portability remains a concern: these Rai stones are sometimes up to 12 feet in diameter and weigh more than 4 tons (more than 8,000 pounds). To save on heavy lifting, Rai sometimes remained in the physical possession of an early owner even if ownership was transferred. In that sense, the stones have significant associations with memory and history and their exchange is sometimes based on a shared understanding. In fact, the value of a specific Rai stone was often tied not just to its size and craftsmanship, but to its history. Although the Yapese now use more conventional forms of money as their everyday currency, Rai stones continue to have symbolic value."

msgid "[[☃ image 1]]Paper currency owes its origins to the dynasties of Middle Age China. In the Tang dynasty (618–907), the ruling class found it burdensome and potentially dangerous to transport heavy copper coinage to and from distant lands, so merchants began to be paid with paper certificates, called “flying cash” because it had a tendency to blow away. The notes were backed up by hard metal currency held in the capital. The Song dynasty that followed issued paper money with bank seals, officially embracing paper money as a means of exchange. The concept is thought to have traveled westward with the Mongols and, by 1661, European nations were also printing paper currency."

msgid "No official “date” marks the opening of the Silk Road, but about 2,000 years ago, during ancient China’s Han dynasty, a government ambassador, Zhang Qian (c. 200–114 BCE), was sent west by the emperor to secure a trade route for silk caravans. Zhang and his officers made peace with some of the nomadic tribes of Central Asia that had previously attacked travelers. After Zhang’s intervention, it became safer for the caravans carrying silk to travel further west, and eventually their trade goods made it all the way to cities on or near the Mediterranean, such as Aleppo, in today’s Syria. They then traveled on sailing ships the rest of the way to the ports of western Europe. Here the fabric was tailored into the gowns and luxury goods of royalty, aristocrats, and wealthy merchants."

The Chinese had invented this luxurious fabric around 2700 BCE (or earlier) and managed to keep the manufacturing process secret for millennia, closely guarding the silkworm that spins a cocoon of the finest filament — the silk thread. Unraveled from the cocoon, and woven together, the silk threads formed a fabric so soft, so sheer, so refined, that kings and queens, dukes and duchesses, wealthy people of the ancient world, were willing to pay extraordinary prices to possess this luxury good that traveled from hand to hand, caravan to caravan, all the way from China to Europe."

In order to learn, it was best to travel to the very source of the knowledge rather than wait for it to come. Chinese monks traveled along branches of the Silk Road to India so they could read the original manuscripts of the Buddha’s teachings, which were safely kept at monasteries there. One of the most famous Chinese novels, _Journey to the West_, follows the adventures of a character, Monkey, who a thousand years ago makes this same pilgrimage to read the Buddhist manuscripts. Monkey has to cross a land of deep canyons and towering mountains very much like the Tibetan Plateau, where demons lie in wait for him."

From the nomadic tribes of Central Asia, Chinese merchants bargained for horses and cattle, leather and furs, ivory and jade. Silk Road caravans employed pack animals such as camels (able to travel in desert regions), yaks (sure-footed and strong-winded for high mountains), and horses. Each animal carried a load of about 300 pounds (136 kilograms). Trading towns or posts lay at regular distances along the Silk Road, as well as travelers’ inns known as caravansaries, where the caravans could rest the night, resupply with food, or trade their goods.

But unlike a modern highway, very few people traversed the Silk Road from one end to the other, from China to the Mediterranean, or vice versa. (Marco Polo was one of the famous travelers who did.) The Silk Road really served, like the Internet does, as a linked network of communication “nodes.” In the way “packets” of information are passed along the Internet from computer node to computer node all over the globe, so were actual packets of goods passed from one trader’s caravan to another, and from one caravan post to another on the Silk Road. After months, or even years, these packets had traveled hundreds or thousands of miles along the Silk Road from, say, China to France, a distance of over 5,000 miles as the crow flies, and closer to 10,000 miles by winding roads and paths."

In order to learn, it was best to travel to the very source of the knowledge rather than wait for it to come. Chinese monks traveled along branches of the Silk Road to India so they could read the original manuscripts of the Buddha’s teachings, which were safely kept at monasteries there. One of the most famous Chinese novels, _Journey to the West_, follows the adventures of a character, Monkey, who a thousand years ago makes this same pilgrimage to read the Buddhist manuscripts. Monkey has to cross a land of deep canyons and towering mountains very much like the Tibetan Plateau, where demons lie in wait for him."

From the nomadic tribes of Central Asia, Chinese merchants bargained for horses and cattle, leather and furs, ivory and jade. Silk Road caravans employed pack animals such as camels (able to travel in desert regions), yaks (sure-footed and strong-winded for high mountains), and horses. Each animal carried a load of about 300 pounds (136 kilograms). Trading towns or posts lay at regular distances along the Silk Road, as well as travelers’ inns known as caravansaries, where the caravans could rest the night, resupply with food, or trade their goods. The journey from one end of the Silk Road to the other could take a year."

But unlike a modern highway, very few people traversed the Silk Road from one end to the other, from China to the Mediterranean, or vice versa. (Marco Polo was one of the famous travelers who did.) The Silk Road really served, like the Internet does, as a linked network of communication “nodes.” In the way “packets” of information are passed along the Internet from computer node to computer node all over the globe, so were actual packets of goods passed from one trader’s caravan to another, and from one caravan post to another on the Silk Road. After months, or even years, these packets had traveled hundreds or thousands of miles along the Silk Road from, say, China to France, a distance of over 5,000 miles as the crow flies, and closer to 10,000 miles by winding roads and paths."

This linking up of different civilizations was an important process because it ensured that collective learning reached further and embraced more people and greater diversity than ever before. Significant exchanges occurred in the Americas, in Australasia, and in the Pacific, but the most important exchange networks emerged in Afro-Eurasia. At this time these four zones were still so isolated from each other that humans living in one remained utterly ignorant of events in the others."

New financial instruments (including printed paper money) were devised to facilitate large-scale commerce. At the same time, Arab merchants — benefiting from the stable and prosperous Abbasid administration in Baghdad (750–1228 CE) — began to engage with their Chinese counterparts in lucrative commercial enterprises, leading to a revival of the Silk Roads."

msgid "During the third century CE, the Silk Roads fell into disuse as both the Chinese and Roman empires withdrew from the network. Silk Roads trade was at least partly responsible for this, because it led to the spread of disastrous epidemic diseases. Smallpox, measles, and bubonic plagues devastated the populations at either end of the routes, where people had less resistance to each other’s diseases. As a result, the population of the Roman Empire fell from perhaps 60 million to 40 million by 400 CE, while that of China may have dropped from 60 million to 45 million by 600 CE."

msgid "In Afro-Eurasia, all agrarian civilizations were linked together into a vast interconnected network by the beginning of the Common Era. This network involved not only the trading of material goods, but also the trading of social, religious, and philosophical ideas, languages, new technologies, and disease. The most important exchange system that existed anywhere during the Common Era is known today as the Silk Roads, but significant smaller connections developed much earlier between many of the agrarian civilizations."

msgid "It was the decision by the Han Chinese in the first century BCE to interact with their western neighbors and engage in long-distance commerce that turned small-scale regional trade into a great trans-Afro-Eurasian exchange network. This occurred around the same time that Augustus came to power in Rome following a century of civil war. In the relatively peaceful era that ensued, the demand for foreign luxury goods in Rome exploded, leading to a huge expansion of both land-based trade routes connecting the Mediterranean with East Asia, and maritime routes connecting Roman Egypt to India."

By the time of the first Silk Roads era just four ruling dynasties — those of the Roman, Parthian, Kushan, and Han empires — controlled much of the Eurasian landmass, from the China Sea to the Atlantic Ocean. Order and stability was established over a vast geopolitical environment, great road networks were constructed, advances were made in metallurgy and transport technology, agricultural production was intensified, and coinage appeared for the first time. By 50 BCE, conditions in Afro-Eurasia were much different than they had been before the consolidation of empires."

msgid "Much Silk Roads trade also took place by sea, between Roman Egypt and the west coast of India. Sailors had discovered the “trade winds,” which blow reliably from the southwest in the summer, allowing heavily laden ships to sail across the Indian Ocean from the coast of Africa to India. The winds reverse in the winter so that the same ships carrying new cargo could make the return journey to Egypt. Whether by land or by sea, however, few traders ever made their way along the entire length of the Silk Roads. Typically, merchants from the major eastern and western agrarian civilizations took their goods as far as central Asia before passing them on to a series of middlemen, like the Kushans, the Sogdians, and the Parthians."

msgid "Other world zones also had their early exchange networks, but none on the scale of the Silk Roads. American trade networks happened over long distances, crossing diverse geographic regions — from the Andes through Mesoamerica and up into North America. But American networks were much smaller and less varied than those of the Silk Roads, probably because the jungles of the equatorial region acted as a barrier. Because of the Silk Roads, Afro-Eurasia was much larger in population, much more technologically dynamic, and also much more interlinked through trade and exchange than the other three world zones were. This is a particularly important distinction because, when the different zones finally collided after 1492, the societies of Afro-Eurasia were quickly able to dominate the rest of the world. And that in turn explains why the modern revolution that followed was destined to be led by Afro-Eurasian peoples, not those from the Americas."

Along these often difficult routes, through some of the harshest geography on Earth, traveled merchants and adventurers, diplomats and missionaries, carrying their commodities and ideas enormous distances across the Afro-Eurasian world zone. Each category of exchange was important, and, as a result of this interaction, Afro-Eurasia has preserved a certain underlying unity, expressed in common technologies, artistic styles, cultures and religions, and even in disease and immunity patterns."

The animal that made Silk Roads trade possible was the Bactrian camel, which was incredibly well adapted to its environment. The humps on its back contain high quantities of fat (not water) to sustain it for long distances, and its long eyelashes and sealable nostrils guard against dust in the frequent sandstorms. The two broad toes on its feet have undivided soles, a natural adaptation to walking on sand. The bulk of overland Silk Roads trade was literally carried on the backs of these extraordinary animals."

A second significant Silk Roads era operated from about 700 to 1200 CE, connecting China, India, Southeast Asia, the Islamic realm, and the Mediterranean into a vast web based on busy overland and maritime trade. The primary function of the Silk Roads during both periods was to facilitate commercial trade, but intellectual, social, and artistic ideas were also exchanged. Historians believe that it is these nonmaterial exchanges that have been of greatest significance to world history."

Even before the Tang came to power, many foreign religions had made their way into East Asia, including Christianity, Manichaeism, and Zoroastrianism. With the advent of Islam in the seventh century and the establishment of substantial Muslim merchant communities in the centuries that followed, mosques also began to appear in many Chinese cities.

It may have a hundred thousand to millions of people living in different types of communities. Each of the four world zones functioned as a separate world, not in regular contact with other zones until Europeans sailed to the Americas late in the 15th century. The world today no longer has four separate world zones — our world is increasingly global."

Afro-Eurasia was so much larger, with better plants for food and animals better suited for transportation, that civilization emerged there several thousand years earlier than in the Americas. This gave peoples from Afro-Eurasia a decisive edge when they arrived in the Americas and found civilizations similar to theirs in structure, but earlier in their development."

msgid "For most of human history, humans existed only in Afro-Eurasia. _Homo sapiens_ migrated to Australasia about 60,000–50,000 BCE and to the Americas about 20,000–15,000 BCE. Human interaction continued among these three areas until the melting at the end of the Ice Age caused sea levels to rise sufficiently to drown the land bridge between Asia and the Americas. There never was a land bridge between Australasia and Afro-Eurasia; a significant sea passage always existed, which is why the arrival of humans in Australasia seems such an achievement. But the passage between Afro-Eurasia and Australasia became wider, and harder to cross, after the seas rose."

Agriculture did emerge in the highlands of Papua New Guinea, but their root crops could not be stored in large quantities and villages were not easily connected. Hence, political structures beyond village life did not emerge. On the Australian mainland, widespread agriculture never developed. Soil was poor and, by chance, the available species of plants were not easy to domesticate. Still, archaeological sites show that the population was increasing in the two millennia before Europeans arrived."

After 1500 CE, extensive travel by sea connected all of the zones and established the first global exchange network."

msgid "[[☃ image 1]]A world zone is simply a large region of human interaction, linked geographically, culturally, economically, and sometimes politically. It may have a hundred thousand to millions of people living in different types of communities. Each of the four world zones functioned as a separate world, not in regular contact with other zones until Europeans sailed to the Americas late in the 15th century. The world today no longer has four separate world zones — our world is increasingly global."

msgid "> When these sheets have been prepared they are cut up into pieces of different sizes....All these pieces of paper are issued with as much solemnity and authority as if they were of pure gold or silver; and on every piece a variety of officials, whose duty it is, have to write their names, and to put their seals. And when all is prepared duly, the chief officer deputed by the Khan smears the Seal entrusted to him with vermilion, and impresses it on the paper, so that the form of the Seal remains printed upon it in red; [it] is then authentic....and he makes them to pass current universally over all his kingdoms and provinces and territories, and whithersoever his power and sovereignty extends. And nobody, however important he may think himself, dares to refuse them on pain of death. And indeed everybody takes them readily, for wheresoever a person may go throughout the Great Khan’s dominions he shall find these pieces of paper current, and shall be able to transact all sales and purchases of goods by means of them."

People were traveling everywhere, usually in groups — by foot, donkey, horse, camel, and boat. Merchants moved goods; kings, sultans, and popes moved armies. Diplomats and envoys carried messages; missionaries sought souls. Pilgrims and scholars searched for enlightenment. People looked for work, and whole groups of people migrated for varying reasons. Captains, caravan leaders, travel guides, and transport experts provided the ways and means to keep the multitudes moving."

First, nomads of Central Asia (the Mongols and their Turkish-speaking allies) conquered Russia, China, and most of the Middle East, creating the largest territorial empire the world had ever seen. Their rulers imposed order and security to the trade routes along the Silk Roads. Second, the stability of Islamic rule across North Africa, the Middle East, Persia, and Southeast Asia provided a common civilization for travelers. Third, improvements in sailing technologies increased sea travel in the Indian Ocean."

They each told their stories from memory, and perhaps some written notes, to others who copied it down. Enough copies were made that some have survived through the centuries. A third traveler featured here, Zheng He, from Yunnan, China, is remembered because he served powerful Chinese emperors. He left brief accounts of his voyages carved in granite, and two officers and a translator who sailed with him left longer memoirs."

Canoes have been used for millennia by many different cultures and continue to be used today. These versatile watercraft are stable in a variety of water conditions and easily transported over land from one body of water to the next. But massive sailing ships like the one seen in the distance are much better suited to long voyages and for the transport of large cargoes."

These massive cargo ships, many more than 1,200 feet long and 150 feet wide, have a load capacity greater than one billion tons. Containers are stacked on the ships’ decks and are loaded and unloaded by giant cranes at harbors in coastal cities."

Competing for the new land resources, several European nations staked their claims to colonies in the New World and sometimes fought over control of specific regions. In this engraving, an armada from the Dutch West India Company of Holland captures a Spanish silver fleet off the coast of Havana, Cuba, in 1628."

msgid "Sailing ships connected the world. But it was steam that took transportation to another level – allowing ships with mechanical engines to move faster and carry heavier loads. The first “steamers” to run regularly scheduled service across the Atlantic made the passage in about 15 days, compared with the two-months required by sailing vessels. From the middle of the 19th century until the late 1960s (when airliners became popular), ocean liners were the primary means of long-distance transportation. The RMS Queen Mary (pictured here) operated from 1936 to 1967\\. A precursor to today’s enormous cruise ships, the 1,019-foot Queen Mary featured two indoor swimming pools, beauty salons, libraries, nurseries, a music studio, a lecture hall, telephone connectivity to anywhere in the world, outdoor paddle tennis courts, and dog kennels."

msgid "The Mediterranean region was one of the first centers of sea commerce as Greek, and then Roman, “galleys” traveled between ports in Europe, Africa, and Asia. The ships were propelled at high speeds by dozens of oarsmen working in unison. With these ships, sails were a secondary form of power. Galleys were used to transport people and goods and were an important instrument of war. In this illustration, the Roman warship pictured has a corvus mounted to its bow. This crane-like machine  was used to damage enemy ships or to lock them to the Roman ship so that Roman soldiers could board them and engage in hand-to-hand combat."

msgid "The idea of an underwater boat has a long history. According to Greek historian Thucydides, divers cleared submerged obstructions during a siege of Syracuse about 400 BCE and legends tell of Alexander the Great using a “diving bell,” a submersible vessel containing air, about 50 years later. By the early 1700s, numerous submarines had been patented in Europe. A hand-powered military submarine named Turtle was even used in the American Revolutionary War. As mechanical know-how increased, numerous new submarines were designed (including the 1859 craft pictured here). Submarine technology has enjoyed great advances over the last 150 years and now highly engineered underwater vessels have reached the oceans’  greatest depths – the Pacific’s Mariana Trench."

msgid "This painting depicts a Viking fleet in rough seas. Viking “longships” set sail from Scandinavian ports in the Norwegian and Baltic seas beginning late in the 8th century. Among the best sailors of their time, Viking crews plied the North Atlantic and traveled south on major waterways like the Volga River. Archaeological evidence indicates that during several centuries of navigation, the Vikings reached destinations like Greenland and Iceland to the west and distant ports like Nekor (in modern-day Morocco), Constantinople (now Istanbul), and Baghdad to the east and south. The Vikings are thought to have been the first group to actively fish the North Atlantic for cod and Viking ships may have landed in North America hundreds of years before other European explorers like Columbus."

msgid "During the life of Ibn Battuta (sometimes spelled Battutah), Islamic civilization stretched from the Atlantic coast of West Africa across northern Africa, the Middle East, and India to Southeast Asia. This constituted the _Dar al-Islam_, or “Abode of Islam.” In addition, there were important communities of Muslims in cities and towns beyond the frontiers of Dar al-Islam. People in the whole “umma,” or community of people believing in one god and his sacred law (“shari’a”), shared doctrinal beliefs, religious rituals, moral values, and everyday manners. In the early 1300s this community was expanding dramatically."

It is so sketchy and confusing that some scholars doubt that he even went to China and believe he merely fabricated this part of his account. He claims to have gone as far north as Beijing, but his description of that is even vaguer than the rest, so perhaps he only got as far north as Zaitun, now Quanzhou. In any case, he admits in the Travels that in China he was unable to understand or accept much of what he saw; it was not part of his familiar Dar al-Islam:"

msgid "Yet there were many differences. Ibn Battuta was an educated, cosmopolitan, gregarious, upper-class man who traveled within a familiar Muslim culture, meeting like-minded people wherever he went. Polo was a merchant, not formally educated, who traveled to strange, unfamiliar cultures, where he learned new ways of dressing, speaking, and behaving. Ibn Battuta told more about himself, the people he met, and the importance of the positions he held. Marco Polo, on the other had, focused on reporting accurate information about what he had observed. How fortunate we are to have accounts from two contrasting intercontinental travelers from more than 600 years ago."

"> In this city of Cambalu [another spelling for Khanbaliq] is the mint of the grand khan, who may truly be said to possess the secret of the alchemists, as he has the art of producing money by the following process. He causes bark to be stripped from those mulberry-trees the leaves of which are used for feeding silk-worms, and takes from it that thin inner ring which lies between the coarser bark and the wood of the tree. This being steeped, and afterwards pounded in a mortar, until reduced to a pulp, is made into paper, resembling that which is made from cotton, but quite black. When ready for use, he has it cut into pieces of money of different sizes, nearly square, but somewhat longer than they are wide...\n"
"> \n"
"> The coinage of this paper money is authenticated with as much form and ceremony as if it were actually of pure gold or silver; for to each note a number of officers, specially appointed, not only subscribe their names, but affix their signets also; and when this has been regularly done by the whole of them, the principal officer, deputed by his majesty, having dipped into vermilion the royal seal committed to his custody, stamps with it the piece of paper, so that the form of the seal tinged with the vermilion remains impressed upon it, by which it receives full authenticity as current money, and the act of counterfeiting it is punished as a capital offence. When thus coined in large quantities, this paper currency is circulated in every part of the grand khan’s dominions; nor dares any person, at the peril of his life, refuse to accept it in payment. All his subjects receive it without hesitation, because wherever their business may call them, they can dispose of it again in the purchase of merchandise they may have occasion for; such as pearls, jewels, gold, or silver. With it, in short, every article may be procured... \n"
"> \n"
"> All his majesty’s armies are paid with this currency, which is to them of the same value as if it were gold or silver. Upon these grounds, it may certainly be affirmed that the grand khan has a more extensive command of treasure than any other sovereign in the universe. (pp. 145–147)"

These stones do not flame, excepting a little when first lighted, but during their ignition give out a considerable heat. It is true there is no scarcity of wood in the country, but the multitude of inhabitants is so immense, and their stoves and baths, which they are continually heating, so numerous, that the quantity could not supply the demand; for there is no person who does not frequent the warm bath at least three times in the week, and during the winter daily, if it is in their power. Every man of rank or wealth has one in his house for his own use; and the stock of wood must soon prove inadequate to such consumption; whereas these stones may be had in the greatest abundance, and at a cheap rate.

As Polo entertained everyone with his tales of traveling to China, Rusticello wrote them down in a French dialect. This is how Polo’s accounts, Europe’s primary source of information about China until the 19th century, came into existence."

msgid "Few texts have provoked more controversy than _The Travels of Marco Polo_. The authorship is not clear — is it Polo or Rusticello? Sometimes the text is in the first-person voice, sometimes in the third-person. How much of the text is based on Polo’s firsthand experience and how much did the author(s) insert secondhand accounts by others? Certainly it’s a mix. What was reported seemed so bizarre to stay-at-home Europeans that the readers often assumed that everything was made up. Yet historians have largely confirmed the facts in Polo’s account of the height of the Mongol dynasty."

About 120 to 140 early manuscripts — hand-printed and fragmentary versions of _The Travels_ — survive, and every one of them is different. The earliest readers were scholars, monks, and noblemen. Soon translations of _The Travels_ appeared, in Venetian, German, English, Catalan, Argonese, Gaelic, and Latin.

"> We, [Zheng] He and the rest, have been favored with a gracious commission from our Sacred Prince to convey to the distant barbarians the favor [earned by their] respectfulness and good faith. While in command of the personnel of the fleet, and [responsible for the great] amount of money and valuables [our] one concern while facing the violence of the winds and the dangers of the nights was that we would not succeed. Would we then have served the nation with utmost loyalty and worshipped the divine intelligence with utmost sincerity? None of us could doubt that this was the source of aid and safety for the fleet in its comings and goings. Therefore we have made manifest the virtue of the goddess with this inscription on stone, which records the years and months of our going to and returning from the foreign [countries] so that they may be remembered forever."

"> [We have] traversed over a hundred thousand li of vast ocean [and have] beheld great ocean waves, rising as high as the sky and swelling and swelling endlessly. Whether in dense fog and drizzling rain or in wind-driven waves rising like mountains, no matter what the sudden changes in sea conditions, we spread our cloudlike sails aloft and sailed by the stars day and night. [Had we] not trusted her [Heavenly Princess’s] divine merit, how could we have done this in peace and safety? When we met danger, once we invoked the divine name, her answer to our prayer was like an echo; suddenly there was a divine lamp which illuminated the masts and sails, and once this miraculous light appeared, then apprehension turned to calm. The personnel of the fleet were then at rest, and all trusted they had nothing to fear. This is the general outline of the goddess’s merit...\n"
"> \n"
"> When we arrived at the foreign countries, barbarian kings who resisted transformation and were not respectful we captured alive, and bandit soldiers who looted and plundered recklessly we exterminated. Because of this the sea routes became pure and peaceful and the foreign peoples could rely upon them and pursue their occupations in safety. All of this was due to the aid of the goddess."

New military threats came from the Mongols in the north and the ministers argued that resources needed to focus on land defenses there instead."

They were based in Beijing, in the north of China near Mongol territory, and they spent a lot of time together campaigning on horseback on the Mongolian steppe. Ma He grew unusually tall and strong and became a skilled fighter and brave leader. When the first Ming emperor died, his grandson (the son of his deceased oldest son) succeeded him. In 1402, Zhu Di took the throne from his nephew by force and proclaimed himself Emperor Yongle (“Perpetual Happiness”). He made his companion Ma He the director of palace servants (similar to a chief of staff), and changed Ma’s name to Zheng He in commemoration of his role in battles to win the throne.

They were based in Beijing, in the north of China near Mongol territory, and they spent a lot of time together campaigning on horseback on the Mongolian steppe. Ma He grew unusually tall and strong and became a skilled fighter and brave leader. When the first Ming emperor died, his grandson (the son of his deceased oldest son) succeeded him. In 1402, Zhu Di took the throne from his nephew by force and proclaimed himself Emperor Yongle (“Perpetual Happiness”). He made his companion Ma He the director of palace servants (similar to a chief of staff), and changed Ma’s name to Zheng He in commemoration of his role in battles to win the throne. (Zheng was the name of Yongle’s favorite warhorse.) Yongle ruled from 1402 to 1424."

One can imagine some adventurous herder youth climbing atop a docile-looking horse for amusement. But whether humans used horses to pull wheeled vehicles such as chariots before they learned to ride them is not certain. Because most of these developments occurred before writing was invented, we depend on archaeological evidence to help us understand what happened."

The chariot was a fearsome weapon and the invention of the saddle, and then the stirrup, which first appears in China about 2,000 years ago, brought a leap forward in the effectiveness of horse-mounted warfare. Now warriors could use their hands more readily to fling spears, slash with swords, or fire arrows while secured on horseback with a saddle, feet planted in stirrups.

msgid "Hunters began to follow the horse herds. While the horse still remained a “wild animal,” humans and horses, in a manner of speaking, grew closer together. Humans could attract the horse by providing ready fodder. They found that they could milk the lactating mare and serve the milk to their own families. The first known evidence of domesticated horses comes from horse dung found inside postholes of what appears to have been a stable in today’s Kazakhstan, dating to 5000 BCE. Ancient knife marks on thousands of horse bones indicate these horses were raised for meat, and perhaps milk."

In North America, before the reintroduction of the horse by the Spaniards, Native Americans on the Great Plains relied on dogs pulling small _travois_ (simple sleds) to carry their tepees, cooking ware, and other goods when they moved from camp to camp. But the horse proved able to carry far heavier loads than a dog could."

Native Americans quickly saw the utility of the horse, and the Plains Indians became expert at horse riding. Early European explorers in North America gave reports of Plains Indian children too young to talk but comfortable riding their own small mounts. Human oceanic travel had brought the horse back to its ancestral home, further adding to the animal’s importance within both foraging and agrarian societies."

msgid "A feedback cycle exists when one thing has an effect on another thing, which has an effect on yet something else, which has an effect on the original thing. Causes and effects are linked together in a loop. A familiar example is a thermostat. A fan is cooling a room. But there’s a thermometer connected to a switch so that when the room is cool enough the switch cuts off the fan, and then the room starts warming up again. Once the temperature hits a certain point, the thermometer trips another switch that restarts the fan and the room starts getting cooler once more. The fan, the thermometer, and the switch are connected in a feedback loop. This is a _negative_ feedback loop because one part of the chain counteracts the effects of the other parts: the thermostat stops the fan. The result is that the temperature remains fairly stable. As a general rule, negative feedback keeps things stable."

Populations and networks were much larger and more diverse in Afro-Eurasia, so it is no surprise that innovations — such as the seafaring technology that brought the zones together — accumulated more powerfully there. The Americas saw the appearance of farming and agrarian civilizations, as well as significant regional networks of exchange, though they were much smaller than those of Afro-Eurasia."

msgid "By now, you are familiar with plate tectonics, and you know that the geography of the Earth has changed over time. If things had gone a bit differently, we humans might have evolved in a world where all the landmasses were stuck together in a single continent. That’s how the Earth was 250 million years ago, when today’s continents were all connected as a single landmass called Pangaea. If humans had evolved on Pangaea, how would that have affected collective learning? For one, it would have made it much easier for humans to spread through the world and to maintain contact with each other. Even if faced with barriers such as large rivers and mountains, humans would surely have found ways to reach all parts of the supercontinent. That suggests that humans might have formed a single, global network much earlier than they did in our actual world. By contrast, imagine if humans had evolved in a world with many isolated islands, separated from each other by oceans. It would have been difficult to move from one landmass to another. And if some humans did manage to cross the oceans, it would have been difficult to get back. This is a scenario for a world of separate, isolated human networks, each developing in its own way and at its own pace. Something similar happened on some of the more remote islands of Polynesia, such as Rapa Nui (Easter Island), one of the most secluded places on Earth."

Modern innovations like the telegraph, the telephone, the radio, and the Internet followed. Each innovation increased the efficiency with which information could be circulated and stored, thereby increasing the efficiency of collective learning, which encouraged even further innovations — a classic example of positive feedback.

From about 5,000 years ago, humans began to ride on domesticated animals such as horses and camels, and also used them to pull carts carrying goods, while boats were increasingly used on major rivers. Technological innovation in watercraft allowed for the movement of goods through the Indian Ocean, and, eventually, the circumnavigation of the world starting in the 16th century.

They can also tell us much about the impact of the eventual coming together of these zones. After 1492, goods, ideas, peoples, crops, animals, and diseases were shared between the world zones, in what historian Alfred Crosby has called the “Columbian Exchange.” The power of this first global network of exchange may count as one of the most important of all explanations for the sudden increase in the power of collective learning and the pace of innovation in recent centuries. But the sheer size and variety of the Afro-Eurasian zone explains why countries from that zone have played such a crucial role in recent centuries."

"> We all know that history has proceeded very differently for peoples from different parts of the globe. In the 13,000 years since the end of the last Ice Age, some parts of the world developed literate industrial societies with metal tools, other parts developed only nonliterate farming societies, and still others retained societies of hunter-gather- ers with stone tools. Those historical inequalities have cast long shadows on the modern world, because the literate societies with metal tools have conquered or exterminated the other societies.\n"
"> \n"
"> While those differences constitute the most basic fact of world history, the reasons for them remain uncertain and controversial. This puzzling question of their origins was posed to me 25 years ago in a simple,\n"
"> \n"
"> personal form. In July 1972 I was walking along a beach on the tropical island of New Guinea, where as a biologist I study bird evolution. I had already heard about a remarkable local politician named Yali, who was touring the district then. By chance, Yali and I were walking in the same direction on that day, and he overtook me. We walked together for an hour, talking during the whole time.\n"
"> \n"
"> Our conversation began with a subject then on every New Guinean’s mind — the rapid pace of political developments. Papua New Guinea, as Yali’s nation is now called, was at that time still administered by Australia as a mandate of the United Nations, but independence was in the air...\n"
"> \n"
"> After a while, Yali turned the conversation and began to quiz me.... [H]e asked me, “Why is it that you white people developed so much cargo and brought it to New Guinea, but we black people had little cargo of our own?”\n"
"> \n"
"> Although Yali’s question concerned only the contrasting lifestyles of New Guineans and of European whites, it can be extended to a larger set of contrasts within the modern world. Peoples of Eurasian origin,\n"
"> \n"
"> especially those still living in Europe and eastern Asia, plus those transplanted to North America, dominate the modern world in wealth and power. Other peoples, including most Africans, have thrown\n"
"> \n"
"> off European colonial domination but remain far behind in wealth and power. Still other peoples, such as the aboriginal inhabitants of Aus-\n"
"> \n"
"> tralia, the Americas, and southernmost Africa, are no longer even masters of their own lands but have been decimated, subjugated, and in some cases even exterminated by European colonialists.\n"
"> \n"
"> Thus, questions about inequality in the modern world can be reformu- lated as follows. Why did wealth and power become distributed as they now are, rather than in some other way? For instance, why weren’t Native Americans, Africans, and Aboriginal Australians the ones who decimated, subjugated, or exterminated Europeans and Asians?\n"
"> \n"
"> We can easily push this question back one step. As of the year 1500, when Europe’s worldwide colonial expansion was just beginning, peoples on different continents already differed greatly in technology and political organization. Much of Europe, Asia, and North Africa was the site of metal-equipped states or empires, some of them on the threshold of industrialization. Two Native American peoples, the Aztecs and the Incas, ruled over empires with stone tools. Parts of sub-Saharan Africa were divided among small states or chiefdoms with iron tools. Most other peoples — including all those of Australia and New Guinea, many Pacific islands, much of the Americas, and small parts of sub-Saharan Africa — lived as farming tribes or even still as hunter-gatherer bands using stone tools. Of course, those technological and political differences as of 1500 were the immediate cause of the modern world’s inequalities. Empires with steel weap- ons were able to conquer or exterminate tribes with weapons of stone and wood. How, though, did the world get to be the way it was in 1500? Once again, we can easily push this question back one step further, by drawing on written histories and archaeological discoveries.\n"
"> \n"
"> Until the end of the last ice age, around 11,000 BCE, all peoples on all continents were still hunter-gatherers. Different rates of development on different continents, from 11,000 BCE to 1500 CE, were what led to the technological and political inequalities of 1500\\. While Aboriginal\n"
"> \n"
"> Australians and many Native Americans remained hunter-gatherers, most of Eurasia and much of the Americas and sub-Saharan Africa gradually developed agriculture, herding, metallurgy, and complex polit- ical organization. Parts of Eurasia, and one area of the Americas, independently developed writing as well. However, each of these new developments appeared earlier in Eurasia than elsewhere.... Thus, we can finally rephrase the question about the modern world’s inequalities as follows: why did human development proceed at such different rates on different continents? Those disparate rates constitute history’s broadest pattern....\n"
"> \n"
"> ...On the one hand, the proximate explanations are clear: some peoples developed guns, germs, steel, and other factors conferring political and economic power before others did; and some peoples never devel- oped these power factors at all. On the other hand, the ultimate explanations — for example, why bronze tools appeared early in parts of Eurasia, late and only locally in the New World, and never in Aboriginal Australia — remain unclear. Our present lack of such ultimate explana- tions leaves a big intellectual gap, since the broadest pattern of history thus remains unexplained.\n"
"> \n"
"> Authors are regularly asked by journalists to summarize a long book in one sentence. For this book, here is such a sentence: “History fol- lowed 100 different courses for different peoples because of differenc- es among peoples’ environments, not because of biological differences among peoples themselves.” Naturally, the notion that environmental geography and biogeography influenced societal development is an old idea. Nowadays, though, the view is not held in esteem by historians; it is considered wrong or simplistic, or it is caricatured as environ- mental determinism and dismissed, or else the whole subject of trying to understand worldwide differences is shelved as too difficult. Yet geography obviously has some effect on history; the open question concerns how much effect, and whether geography can account for history’s broad pattern.\n"
"> \n"
"> The time is now ripe for a fresh look at these questions, because of new information from scientific disciplines seemingly remote from human history. Those disciplines include, above all, genetics, mol- ecular biology, and biogeography as applied to crops and their wild ancestors; the same disciplines plus behavioral ecology, as applied to domestic animals and their wild ancestors; molecular biology of human germs and related germs of animals; epidemiology of human diseases; human genetics; linguistics; archaeological studies on all continents and major islands; and studies of the histories of technology, writing, and political organization....\n"
"> \n"
"> ...[F]ood production — that is, the growing of food by agriculture or herding, instead of the hunting and gathering of wild foods — ulti- mately led to the immediate factors permitting [Eurasians’] triumph [over non-Eurasians’]. But the rise of food production varied around the globe...\n"
"> \n"
"> [P]eoples in some parts of the world developed food production by themselves; some other peoples acquired it in prehistoric times from those independent centers; and still others neither developed nor acquired food production prehistorically but remained hunter- gatherers until modern times....\n"
"> \n"
"> ...Geographic differences in the local suites of wild plants and animals available for domestication go a long way toward explaining why only a few areas became independent centers of food production, and why it arose earlier in some of those areas than in others. From those few centers of origin, food production spread much more rapidly to some areas than to others. A major factor contributing to those differ- ing rates of spread turns out to have been the orientation of the continents’ axes: predominantly west-east for Eurasia, predominantly north-south for the Americas and Africa.\n"
"> \n"
"> ....Far more Native Americans and other non-Eurasian peoples were killed by Eurasian germs than by Eurasian guns or steel weapons. Conversely, few or no distinctive lethal germs awaited would-be Euro- pean conquerors in the New World. Why was the germ exchange so unequal? Here, the results of recent molecular biological studies are illuminating in linking germs to the rise of food production, in Eurasia much more than in the Americas.\n"
"> \n"
"> Another chain of causation led from food production to writing, possi- bly the most important single invention of the last few thousand years. Writing has evolved de novo only a few times in human history, in areas that had been the earliest sites of the rise of food production in their respective regions.... Hence, for the student of world history, the phenomenon of writing is particularly useful for exploring another important constellation of causes: geography’s effect on the ease with which ideas and inventions spread.\n"
"> \n"
"> What holds for writing also holds for technology. A crucial question is whether technological innovation is so dependent on rare inventor- geniuses, and on many idiosyncratic cultural factors, as to defy an understanding of world patterns. In fact, we shall see that, paradoxically, this large number of cultural factors makes it easier, not harder, to understand world patterns of technology. By enabling farmers to generate food surpluses, food production permitted farming societies to support full-time craft specialists who did not grow their own food and who developed technologies.\n"
"> \n"
"> Besides sustaining scribes and inventors, food production also enabled farmers to support politicians.... Mobile bands of hunter-gatherers are relatively egalitarian, and their political sphere is confined to the band’s own territory and to shifting alliances with neighboring bands. With the rise of dense, sedentary, food-producing populations came the rise of chiefs, kings, and bureaucrats. Such bureaucracies were essential not only to governing large and populous domains but also to maintaining standing armies, sending out fleets of exploration, and organizing wars of conquest.\n"
"> \n"
"> [T]his book identifies several constellations of environmental factors that I believe provide a large part of the answer to Yali’s question. Recognition of those factors emphasizes the unexplained residue, whose understanding will be a task for the future....\n"
"> \n"
"> Perhaps the biggest of these unsolved problems is to establish human history as a historical science, on a par with recognized historical sciences such as evolutionary biology, geology, and climatology. The study of human history does pose real difficulties, but those recognized historical sciences encounter some of the same challenges. Hence the methods developed in some of these other fields may also prove useful in the field of human history. Already, though, I hope to have convinced you, the reader, that history is not “just one damn fact after another,” as a cynic put it. There really are broad patterns to history, and the search for their explanation is as productive as it is fascinating...."

msgid "Bugs and diseases traveled too, and in regions unused to them the results were sometimes catastrophic. In Afro-Eurasia, where exchanges of goods, people, and diseases went back many centuries, populations had developed a wide range of immunities. When humans from Afro-Eurasia arrived in the Americas and, later, in the Australasian and Pacific world zones, they brought their diseases with them, with devastating results. According to some estimates, populations in the more densely settled regions of the Americas, namely Mesoamerica and the Andes, may have fallen by as much as 90 percent. For the Americas, this was a catastrophe much worse than the Black Death, which had devastated Afro-Eurasian societies in the 14th century.

So, too, have the plants and animals that humans use, as well as the viruses and bacteria that carry human diseases, and the hangers-on of human societies, such as rats and cockroaches and fleas. After millions of years in which particular species of plants, animals, and bacteria have been confined to those parts of the world in which they evolved, suddenly many species began to appear in all parts of the world. Crosby called this remarkable phenomenon the “Columbian Exchange.”"

Today, a third of all the crops grown in China originated in the Americas. The Columbian Exchange represented an agricultural revolution, and it is no wonder that populations began to rise in many regions around this time."

The horse-riding cultures of the American Plains Indians evolved as com- munities that had largely depended on farming learned to tame horses and hunt in new ways. (Ironically, horses had evolved in the Americas only to vanish soon after the arrival of the first humans, so they survived only in Eurasia where their ancestors had probably migrated across the Bering land bridge during the Ice Age.)​"

In a wonderful book on the traces that human societies will leave behind, geologist Jan Zalasiewicz argues that, 100 million years in the future, a competent alien paleontologist will be able to notice this sudden “McDonaldization” of the species on Earth. That observer will see it most easily studying fossilized pollen from crops such as maize and rice, but may also notice a strange globalization of species such as rats and cockroaches. Zalasiewicz writes, “The transfer of species globally has become a merry-go-round of living organisms without precedent in the Earth’s four-and-a-half-billion-year history.”"

msgid "The Amazon jungle is one of the most biologically diverse areas of the planet. Vast, and rich in vegetation, the Amazon's capacity for absorbing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere is immense. However, deforestation and severe droughts have compromised the health of the rainforest. In the decade from 1991 to 2000, a tract of land the size of Spain was cleared for agriculture and development. Deforestation has slowed down in recent years but thousands of square kilometers are still cleared every year."

Explorers have attempted to find a northern shortcut between Asia and Europe since the end of the 15th century but no one was able to \"make the Northwest Passage\" until early in the 20th century. Recent climate change has opened up the gap in the ice for longer periods of time and now there are cruise ships that ply these waters in the summer months."

msgid "But the future that matters most to us is the near future, the next hundred years or so. And here, unfortunately, prediction is much more difficult. The pace of change has accelerated so fast that things can sometimes seem out of control. There are quite a few worrisome trends that could threaten the future of our children and grandchildren: the increasing consumption of ever-scarcer resources (such as water, farmland, and fossil fuels); growing rates of extinction of other species; the progressively destructive power of weapons; the acidification of the oceans; and the rapid escalation of greenhouse gas emissions. If we cannot bring these changes under control, future generations will face serious challenges that may drastically reduce their standards of living and could even threaten their existence. So you could argue that we live in bleak and dangerous times."

msgid "Historians don’t normally talk about the future for the very good reason that, unlike the past, it is unpredictable. However, in a Big History course you can’t really avoid it. After all, we’ve been looking at huge trends: the expansion of the Universe, increasing complexity, the movements of tectonic plates, expanded human energy consumption, and global warming among them. Trends as large as these don’t stop on a dime. They’re more like an oil tanker cruising at top speed with a full tank; try to stop it by slamming the engines into reverse and it will sail on for several kilometers before it comes to a halt. So it’s useful, for predictive purposes, that they will continue into the future; they can help us learn a few things about what’s coming next. Besides, the near future — specifically the next 100 years or so — really matters! This will be the time that you, your children, and your grandchildren will be living in. And what the future is like will depend in part on what we do now. So in a sense, this is the point when you and your generation will start taking over the story of big history."

msgid "The easiest trends to predict are the simplest and the most prominent. At the greatest scale, we know the Universe is expanding and we believe it is trending toward simplicity. In the late 1990s, astronomers found that the rate of expansion of the Universe seems to be increasing as the Universe gets larger. So it looks as if the Universe will get larger and larger. This means that eventually the Universe could also start getting simpler and simpler as it gets harder and harder to build complex things. Tens or hundreds of billions of years in the future, the gaps between clusters of galaxies will increase until each cluster will seem to be alone. By then, stars will slowly be shutting down as they run out of hydrogen, and the lights will start turning off."

msgid "Threshold 8 gave us the explosion of new technologies that made us the most powerful species on Earth and allowed us to consume more and more of the Earth’s resources. Threshold 8 gave us the “Anthropocene.” What will the next major threshold of increasing complexity be? Will it involve us humans using collective learning to build a world in which we live more sustainably with the biosphere? One very good trend we can see right now is a slowing of the rate of human population growth. For several centuries, human numbers have increased faster than ever before, but in the late 20th century it became clear that those rates are slowing, and they are slowing quite fast. Many demographers expect that human numbers will settle at about nine to 10 billion in the next 100 years and then, perhaps, begin to fall. Is that a first hint of a more sustainable future?"

Geologist Walter Alvarez and others had theorized that a large asteroid had struck the Earth about 65 million years ago, wiping out the dinosaurs. Finding the crater – and confirming the impact date by studying evidence of tsunamis caused by the massive impact – clinched the argument."

Suess is also credited with being the first person to propose the existence of the supercontinent Gondwanaland and the ancient Tethys Ocean, based upon his work studying fossils in the Alps and his knowledge of the fossils of Glossopteris ferns that were found on several different continents."

msgid "These smaller areas are called “ecosystems,” and they are characterized by particular geologic or climatic features that accommodate certain forms of life. Oceans, jungles, and mountain ranges can be ecosystems, but even more specific places can be their own ecosystems. Think of a cave, a river or river valley, a coral reef, a city, or the “vent communities” that surround black smokers on the ocean floor. Altitude, latitude, longitude, climate, soils, and terrain can all contribute to the distinct features of an ecosystem — the Earth’s geologic processes have produced a multitude of diverse environ- ments. The biosphere boasts incredible diversity and, even in extreme environmental conditions, astounding examples of life’s flexibility and determination."

msgid "[[☃ image 1]]At the time, no one knew about plate tectonics (German meteorologist Alfred Wegener didn’t put forth his theory on continental drift until 1912, a couple of years before Suess died), and the best explanation Suess could offer for the presence of marine fossils in the mountains was that the waters of the Tethys Ocean had flooded the whole Earth, not that the continents had actually drifted apart and changed. This is a great example of how limited evidence can sometimes lead scientists to settle on incorrect conclusions.  It also demonstrates how the work of one person can build on that of others, collectively leading to new discoveries about the world around us."

In late 1952 she recorded an especially clear X-ray diffraction image that her col- league, Maurice Wilkins, later showed to Watson in January 1953 without telling Franklin or asking her permission. Franklin and Wilkins did not always communicate well, so his actions were perhaps not surprising."

msgid "Five weeks after their first article in _Nature_, Crick and Watson published another article proposing the idea that, to make a copy, the double helix un-zips, or separates, into two strands — each a backbone of sugar-phosphates with the four bases attached in some sequence. Then the cell uses each strand as a template to assemble another DNA strand from free-floating complementary bases: A picks up T, while C picks up G. This would result in two identical DNA molecules, one a copy of the other. Occasional mistakes in copying enable evolution to occur and each organism to be unique. This idea has been confirmed, while the means for carrying it out have proved to be immensely complex."

Finally, they visualized a structure that solved the puzzle: If two of the bases were bonded in pairs (G with C), they took up the same space as the other pair (A with T). Hence, they could be arranged like steps on a spiral staircase inside of two strands of sugar-phosphates running in opposite directions."

msgid "Over in Cambridge, biochemists were supposed to leave the study of DNA to the lab at King’s College. Francis Crick, age 35 in 1951, was working on his PhD in the crystallography of proteins. He had grown up in a small English village and, since he had failed to qualify for Cambridge, took his undergraduate degree in physics from the University of London. Watson, only 23 in 1951, was at Cambridge as a postdoctorate fellow in biology with limited knowledge of chemistry. He had grown up in Chicago, performed on the national radio show “Whiz Kids,” entered the University of Chicago at age 15, and secured his doctorate from the University of Indiana at just 22\\. He was at the Cambridge lab to learn crystallography."

msgid "The question became how to study the DNA molecule. Biochemists believed that understanding its structure would reveal how the molecule coded the instructions for copying a new organism. They began taking X-ray images of crystals of DNA, believing that its crystallization meant it must have a regular structure. The pattern of the X-rays bouncing off atoms (a phenomenon called “diffraction”) gave information about their location in the molecule. One of the pioneers of this technique, called “X-ray crystallography,” was Linus Pauling, who worked at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena. In the early 1950s Pauling, a prominent chemist doing molecular research in the States, seemed a likely candidate to unlock the mystery of life, since he had already concluded that the general shape of DNA must be a helix, or spiral."

A God who can make a universe that can make itself by way of natural processes, Kingsley proposed, is much more impressive and worthy of worship than one who is always tinkering with the world or keeping it tied to divine puppet strings."

msgid "Likewise, the Catholic priest and renowned geologist and paleontologist Pierre Teilhard de Chardin (1881–1955) wrote many works arguing that his own faith makes more sense after Darwin than it did before. As one of the first exponents of big history, Teilhard emphasized that evolutionary biology — along with geology, astrophysics, and cosmology — clearly demonstrated that the Universe is still coming into being. The fact that this process involves struggling, chance, failure, and loss — along with grandeur and beauty — is completely consistent with the fact that the Universe remains unfin- ished. The role of a creator, Teilhard proposed, is not to force the Universe to fit tightly and immediately into a prefabricated mold, but to open it to an ever-widening range of new possibilities as it moves toward a fresh future."

msgid "This approach claims that science and faith are responding to completely different kinds of questions, and so there can be no genuine conflict between evolution and theology. The contrast approach argues that people should simply acknowledge that sacred scriptures are not science and that Darwinian science has nothing to do with faith. In the Roman Catholic Church, for example, Pope Leo XIII in 1893 instructed the faithful not to look for scientific information in biblical texts. Galileo had given his fellow Catholics the same advice back in the 17th century. As far as evolution is concerned, therefore, Darwin’s theory of life’s descent and diversity should never be placed in competition with biblical creation narratives. The creation stories in the Bible were not intended to satisfy scientific curiosity but to urge devotees to be grateful for the richness of creation. The Bible’s intention is to answer questions such as “Why is there anything at all rather than nothing?” and “Is there an eternal reason for trusting that life is worthwhile?”"

msgid "This approach sees truth in both science and religion, and since truth cannot contradict truth, scientific and religious truths must be reconcilable. It adds that in the real world science and faith can enrich each other. This means that, after Darwin, people of faith cannot have exactly the same thoughts about God as before. Religious believers and theologians need to readjust their thinking about God after Darwin no less than they did after Copernicus’s demonstration of a Sun-centered Solar System. Challenges such as evolution are essential to keeping faith and theology alive and healthy. Theology was eventually able to adjust to a heliocentric Universe, so it can now adjust to evolution. The theory of evolution and faith in a creative and providential deity are not mutually exclusive and numerous theologians and scientists have found ways to reconcile these beliefs. In their view, there is no necessary danger to religious faith in thinking bold new thoughts about God after Darwin. After all, even the idea of God, whether people are aware of it or not, has evolved over the course of time, and it will continue to do so. If we take the time to think about God in terms of evolution, convergence argues, religious understanding will have everything to gain and nothing to lose."

Conflict comprises two main groups. On one side are “creation- ists” and proponents of “intelligent design.” Both groups reject evolution as scientifically misguided. Creationists are Christians (and Muslims) who consider their holy books to be the source of true science and who therefore reject Darwinian evolution as simply wrong. Proponents of intelligent design do not necessarily read the scriptural texts literally, but they consider the complexity of life and subcellular mechanisms too staggering to be the result of natural causes alone. They argue that a supernatural agency is responsible for the complex “design” that exists in the domain of life."

msgid "What did Darwin think about God? After returning (in 1836) from his sea voyage, he spent the next 20 years or so brooding about the theological implications of his discoveries. He had once taken for granted, as almost everyone else did at the time, that all living species came into being by God’s _special_ _creation_ in the beginning. However, reflecting on what he had observed during his sea voyage, Darwin began to wonder how his Christian faith could be true. His doubts continued to grow, probably reinforced by the anguish he experienced at the deaths of his father and 10-year-old daughter, Annie. In his autobiography Darwin writes: “Disbelief crept over me at a very slow rate, but was at last complete. The rate was so slow that I felt no distress, and have never since doubted for a single second that my conclusion was correct.”"

msgid "Critical to self-generation is obtaining the molecules and the energy that the self needs to run the store. One strategy is to use photosynthesis, turning the Sun’s light energy into food. The second is to ingest molecules that are made as a consequence of photosynthesis — that is, to eat — and then break them down, using the energy released to drive self-generation. Here again, the shapes of enzymes are critical, but instead of controlling the formation of chemical bonds as in self-generation, they deftly supervise the breaking of chemical bonds, coupling this activity with the formation of energy-rich molecules like ATP (adenosine triphosphate) that keep the cell going."

Organisms are about something, for something: muscles are for movement; eyes are for seeing. Organisms have goals.

The long-term goal is to pass genome copies on to offspring, a goal that succeeds only if self-generation and self-maintenance succeed.

Daughter organisms inherit copies of genomes from parent organisms, allowing that kind of organism to continue and spread."

msgid "The most interesting mutations are those that generate instructions for a viable daughter that is somewhat different from its parent. For example, a parent duck may have delicate foot webbing while the webbing of a mutant daughter may be extra-thick. What happens next is totally dependent on environmental context. If the ducks hang out on mudflats, the mutant feet may allow for surer footing, hence better opportunities for feeding and fleeing predators, and the thick-footed trait will likely spread into future generations; if the ducks live in grasslands, the mutant feet may slow things down and the trait will be less likely to spread."

Yet Darwin knew that variations occurred and could be magnified, as seen in what he termed “artificial selection”: say, when dog or pigeon breeders select animals with the traits they want. They then let these animals reproduce together but not with ones that don’t carry the traits, eventually resulting in new breeds of dogs and pigeons. Darwin called his idea “natural selection” to contrast it with artificial selection, or breeding."

msgid "Darwin developed his unusual talent for observing natural phenomena and recording what he saw. The one subject that had fired his imagination at Cambridge University was collecting beetles. During his adult years he studied barnacles, bees, orchids, ants, rabbits, pigeons, earthworms, and insectivorous plants. He tramped over his countryside collecting samples and even paid his staff to help. He filled his hothouse with seedlings. He begged information and samples from correspondents everywhere. His eyes seemed always in tune with the vast diversity of life."

Second, geographical distribution showed that species are descended from local ancestors, even if the environment is similar elsewhere. Third, he identified unexpected similarities between species, such as the fact that cats, whales, bats, and humans all have fingers. The finger bones showed that these species, despite their huge differences, are all related to each other."

He visited his extended family, traveled to London occasionally, and wrote thousands of letters to people all over the world, asking questions and seeking information. Penny postage stamps were introduced in Britain in 1840 (the first in the world), and communication improved steadily as the British built their empire.

msgid "Darwin’s book ignited a widespread controversy, but within a decade many scientists accepted his ideas. Since that time, new evidence has clearly supported Darwin’s concepts. For example, biologists have been able to watch species change in relation to their environment. They have discovered the structure of the genetic code, DNA, and understand how it works to pass on traits and to produce a few variations, called “mutations.” Genetic and fossil evidence has proved that the human species emerged in Africa and is most closely related to chimpanzees. By the end of the 20th century Darwin’s theory of evolution had been buttressed by so much confirming evidence that scientists accepted it as fact, and it has become the foundation of modern biology."

The warmer world disrupted ocean circulation patterns and the position of the currents that convey downward warm surface water with oxygen and upward the cold bottom water with less oxygen. Without the mixing of the ocean layers, the bottom water became anoxic, without oxygen. This allowed green sulfur bacteria, which live on sulfur not oxygen, to expand. They produced hydrogen sulfide, which bubbled up, killing much of life and destroying the ozone layer, which protected life against ultraviolet rays from the Sun."

To find this crater, they had charted tiny variations in the pull of gravity, which reflected variations in rock density. From these maps, geologists could tell where the dense and light rocks were located beneath the sea. But not until 1991 did the K-T researchers get together with the PEMEX geologists, who tended not to publish their information, and realize that the “crater of doom” had been found. They named it Chixculub (a Mayan word pronounced cheek-shoe-lube), after the small coastal town nearby."

It began in the mid-1970s with a young geologist, Walter Alvarez, in the mountains of Italy, near the town of Gubbio. There he found a thin layer of clay a centimeter thick between the layers of Cretaceous and Tertiary limestone; the Cretaceous layer contained many fossilized single-celled marine organisms, while very few appeared in the Tertiary layer. In the stratum between, Alvarez’s associates found iridium, an element extremely rare in the Earth’s crust but more common in meteorites. This suggested an impact by an asteroid or comet around the date of the extinction. In 1980 the Alvarez team presented its hypothesis that an asteroid/ comet had hit and had caused massive, rapid extinction by altering the air and water. Further research around the world showed that high levels of iridium existed in the rock record at other K-T boundary sites."

msgid "**DC:** Right. Well, this actually was a problem. There was a Russian scientist called Budyko who did some very simple climate calculations at the end of the 1960s — this is back when people were using pen and paper, not computers, to model a climate system. He realized that that was a possible state that you could get into for the Earth, just a reflective kind of ball bearing. He couldn’t actually work out how it could get out of that state. Then in the 1990s, a scientist, Joe Kirschvink, who works at the California Institute of Technology and actually coined the phrase “Snowball Earth,” worked with this idea further. He saw a way to get out of an increasingly colder, ice-covered Earth."

msgid "**DC:** Well, of the volcanoes that go off today, individually the amount of carbon dioxide they put out into the atmosphere is still quite small compared to the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere as a whole. So the way they tend to affect climate actually is to cool the climate. The way they do that is because they also put out a lot of sulfur gases and some of them are the types of volcanoes where the sulfur gets up into the stratosphere and it reacts with water vapor. And there are tiny sulfuric acid particles and they’re very reflective. So they reflect the sunlight and they can actually cool the planet for maybe a year or two until eventually they disappear. They fall out of the stratosphere."

msgid "And there’s a minor one, a little glaciation which we don’t think was a Snowball Earth, about 580 million years ago. After, sometime between 630 and 580 million years ago, there’s the very first signs of animals. Some look to be like sponges. There are also some molecules that were left behind; some organic molecules. We think, again, that the increase of oxygen would of at least been a precursor to allowing more complex forms of life to arise."

msgid "So the overall story here is that the evolution of the biosphere (the network of life on Earth) and the evolution of the atmosphere were linked. It was biology that changed the atmosphere, but then the atmospheric change, changed biology. So we couldn’t have had the oxygen-rich atmosphere without the photosynthetic bacteria in the very early oceans, but we couldn’t have had the animals without the oxygen coming in. There was an interplay between what the biosphere was doing and what the Earth was doing that included geologic events like volcanoes, organic processes like photosynthesis, and changes in the atmosphere."

msgid "So the ozone layer is a layer in the stratosphere; a layer enriched in the molecule which we call ozone which is O3 — three oxygen atoms joined together. The height where there is the biggest concentration of ozone is about 25 kilometers above the modern Earth. So what happens is anoxygen molecule (O2) gets zapped by ultraviolent sunlight and it breaks apart and makes two oxygen atoms. But one oxygen atom then can combine with an O2 molecule and it can make an O3. So the abundance of O3 molecules — the ozone molecules — ultimately are connected to how much oxygen is available in the atmosphere."

We don’t know exactly when it started and exactly when it finished, but we do know that in these rocks that were dragged along and eventually deposited by the glaciers, there’s some volcanic ash that we can date quite nicely. The volcanoes spewed out some ash and it deposited. That’s about 720 million years ago. Then the next one is something like 635 million years ago where we can find the volcanic ash in the glacial sediments again."

Normally it would dissolve in rain water and it would react with the surface and be diminished, but in the absence of rain and the absence of the ocean being in intimate contact with the atmosphere, the carbon dioxide builds up. It’s a greenhouse gas and eventually it reaches a threshold and then it will melt back the ice sheet."

msgid "A living organism has thousands of different kinds of protein shapes, enabling it to self-organize and self-maintain, to reproduce and adapt. How is this even possible inside of a single cell? One useful way to think about this is with a concept called “emergence.” There’s a T-shirt slogan for emergence that goes, “You get _something else_ from _nothing but_.” What does that mean? Well, the nothing buts are important parts of a system that form relationships with, and organize themselves with respect to, one another. When that happens, the something else that wasn’t there before, a new property or capability, pops through."

Natural selection is looking at traits such as blood circulation and motility. It’s not looking at the proteins and protein shapes. It can’t see the genes. It has no idea how the traits are generated. The criterion for selection is whether a particular version of a trait is adaptive (favorable) or not adaptive (unfavorable) to the particular environmental context where the organism is making its living."

The receptor is usually a protein, and when the signal and the receptor interact, the protein changes its shape. In your nose, for example, the odor receptors are one shape when you’re not smelling anything; but when a particular odorant comes in, certain receptors bind to that odorant and change their shape."

In fact, there’s very little that we do understand about it. We know that because brains can remember, a mammal with a huge memory store is not only aware of what it’s sensing in the moment, it’s also aware of all the things that it remembers. So it’s much more knowledgeable about the world than if it just had a protein receptor reacting to an outside signal, as with a single-celled organism."

When green plants first started in with photosynthesis it altered the atmosphere, greatly increasing oxygen levels. Many species, unaccustomed to an oxygen-rich climate and unable to survive, perished in what scientists sometimes call \"the Great Oxidation Event\" or \"the Oxygen Holocaust.\" Other life forms liked the new air and flourished."

Deep sea vents, or \"black smokers\" as they are often called, occur at oceanic ridges where new sea floor emerges from the Earth's mantle. Scientists believe that some of the earliest life on Earth may have formed around these vents when chemical rich material from within the Earth poured into the oceans. Today's \"vent communities\" include tube worms, a variety of crustaceans and special bacteria that convert chemicals into energy rather than using the Sun's light."

Chloroplasts capture light energy and carbon dioxide and transform them into energy-rich molecules like ATP and NADPH and, eventually, glucose."

In some ways, Jupiter is more like a star, or a “failed star” than like a planet since its composition is primarily hydrogen and helium. But Jupiter never heated up enough to start burning its hydrogen, as stars do.  If you look closely to the left side of the image, you can see the shadow cast by Europa, one of the largest of Jupiter’s more than 50 moons."

The star system depicted, NGC 1333-IRAS 4B, is 1,000 light years away in the constellation Perseus. Its central stellar embryo is still \"feeding\" off the material collapsing around it and continues to grow. Astronomers cannot tell how large the star will ultimately become or what types of planets will form around it but they’ve identified enough water vapor in the star system to fill Earth’s oceans five times."

msgid "Astronomers feel confident that our Solar System formed by accretion because now they are able to glimpse a similar process occurring in part of the Orion Nebula. This planet-forming area is on the near side of a giant cloud complex that embraces much of the constellation Orion, 1,500 light- years from Earth. Since 1993, astronomers have discovered several hundred stars there in the process of formation, most of them surrounded by rings of dust in accretion disks, just like the one they believe produced the solar planets. These clouds of dust and gas around new stars in the Orion Nebula may develop into planetary systems similar to our own."

Most of them are giants, closer in size to Jupiter, as larger planets have proved easier to detect hundreds of light-years away.

msgid "In the early 1960s, dating of ocean-core samples showed that the ocean floor was younger at the Mid-Atlantic Ridge but progressively older in either direction, confirming the reality of seafloor spreading. Further evidence came along by 1963, as geophysicists realized that Earth’s magnetic field had reversed polarity many times, with each reversal lasting less than 200,000 years. Rocks of the same age in the seafloor crust would have taken on the magnetic polarity prevalent at the time that that part of the crust formed. Sure enough, surveys of either side of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge showed a symmetrical pattern of alternating polarity stripes. That clinched the argument for most geologists."

In 1908 he began to teach at the University of Marburg, and in 1911 he co-wrote _The Thermodynamics of the Atmosphere_, a textbook that became popular; his fellow author, Vladimir Köppen, was a famous climatologist. Wegener married Köppen’s daughter, Else, two years later."

msgid "The force that moves the plates is thought to be convection currents in the mantle under the Earth’s crust. The mantle is solid in the short term, but flows very slowly over geologic timescales. Pockets of hot liquid magma ooze up along extensive mountain ridges deep under the water, one running roughly north-south in the mid-Atlantic and another in the mid-Pacific. Along these ridges are found active volcanoes and hydrothermal (hot-water) vents, also known as “black smokers.” Through these vents pours very hot, mineral-rich water that supports astonishing ecosystems, the only ones on Earth whose immediate energy source is not sunlight. It’s possible that these “vent communities” are where the first living organisms on Earth developed."

He looked for further evidence, found it, and, in 1915, published _The Origin of Continents and Oceans_.

He argued against the claim that earlier land bridges between the continents had sunk.

Ocean floor exploration continued, and by the 1950s other researchers had found that a huge rift ran along the top of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. That enabled Hess to understand his ocean floor profiles in the Pacific. He realized that the Earth’s crust had been moving away on each side of oceanic ridges, down the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, that were long and volcanically active. He published his theory in _History of Ocean Basins_ (1962), and it came to be called “seafloor spreading.”"

If one plate is heavier, it may go under the other, a process known as “subduction.” The material of the subducted plate returns to the mantle, recycling the Earth’s crust. Or the plates may move sideways, grinding against each other. This grinding produces cracks, or faults, in the plates, as along the California coast; these fractures are called “transform plate boundaries.” In whatever form the plate edges meet, earthquakes take place; on a global map of earthquake zones, the outlines of the plates are clearly visible."

msgid "A century after Eratosthenes, the Greek astronomer Posidonius of Rhodes (c. 135–51 BCE) calculated the Earth’s circumference. Posidonius used the star Canopus as frame of reference: when the star is visible at the horizon in Rhodes, it is 7.5 degrees above the horizon in Alexandria. His first calculations came out almost exactly correct, but he revised the distance between Rhodes and Alexandria, which resulted in a number comparable to about 18,000 miles (about 29,000 kilometers), some 28 percent smaller than the actual circumference. Ptolemy reported the calculations of Posidonius instead of those of Eratosthenes, and it was Ptolemy’s writings that found their way to Christopher Columbus. If Ptolemy had used Eratosthenes’s larger, more accurate figure for Earth’s circumference, Columbus might never have sailed west."

He knew that the circumference of Earth constituted a circle of 360 degrees, so 7.12 (or 7.2, to divide 360 evenly by 50) degrees would be about one-fiftieth of the circumference. He also knew the approximate distance between Alexandria and Syene, so he could set up this equation:"

At noon one day each year — the summer solstice (between June 20 and June 22) — the Sun’s rays shone straight down into the deep pit. They illuminated only the water at the bottom, not the sides of the well as on other days, proving that the Sun was directly overhead. (Syene was located very close to what we call the Tropic of Cancer, ~23.5 degrees north, the northernmost latitude at which the Sun is ever directly overhead at noon.)"

For one thing, he was using as his unit of measure the Greek unit “stadion,” or the length of an athletic stadium. But not all stadiums were built the same length. In Greece a stadion equaled roughly 185 meters (607 feet), while in Egypt the stadion was about 157.5 meters (517 feet). We don’t know which unit Eratosthenes used.

msgid "In the early days of Earth, a process called differentiation separated our planet into distinct layers. Density was the key here. Heavier, denser metals like iron and nickel formed the Earth's core while the extremely tightly-packed rocky mantle (some of it molten) surrounded the core. The layer of lighter rock at the Earth's surface is called the crust. It's important to remember that the formation process and ongoing activity created areas where different materials mix, such as veins of metal that reach to the Earth's surface and volcanoes that pump molten lava from the Earth's mantle, sending ash and carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, Earth's outer, gaseous layer."

As oceanic crust is pressed downward into the Earth's mantle, the \"subduction zone\" becomes a geologically active region, prone to both volcanoes and earthquakes."

This slow motion collision happened about 50 million years ago, thrusting earth and stone skyward and forming many of the planet's highest mountains, including Mount Everest (8,848 m/29,029 ft.).

msgid "The Earth's iron-nickel inner core is hotter than the surface of the Sun but intense pressure makes it solid metal. Molten metal in the outer core generates the Earth's magnetic field and the intense heat sends convection currents into the rocky mantle. These currents, or seismic waves, move through the mantle, causing the movement of the Earth's tectonic plates. The crust, a relatively thin layer around the Earth (think of an apple skin), is composed primarily of basalt (in the oceanic crust) and granite (in the continental crust)."

msgid "Wegener’s idea that the continents had moved was not accepted by the scientific community until more evidence was found. Geologist and naval officer Harry Hess used sonar readings of the ocean floor, some taken during World War II, to demonstrate \"seafloor spreading,\" helping to cement the modern theory of plate tectonics. Now scientists know that the Earth’s crust consists of several interacting plates that fit together like a jigsaw puzzle. There can be intense pressure where two or more plates meet and these \"plate boundaries\" are responsible for most of the earthquakes and volcanoes on Earth."

"> Geology defined — Compared to History — Its relation to other Physical Sciences  Geology is the science which investigates the successive changes that have taken place in the organic and inorganic kingdoms of nature. It inquires into the causes of these changes. And it describes the influence which they have exerted in modifying the surface and external structure of our planet.  \n"
"> \n"
"> By this research into the state of the Earth and its inhabitants at former periods, we acquire a more perfect knowledge of its present condition. Our views concerning the laws governing its animate and inanimate productions become more comprehensive. When we study history, we obtain a more profound insight into human nature. We can draw comparisons between the present and former states of society. We trace the long series of events which have gradually led to the current state of affairs.  \n"
"> \n"
"> By connecting effects with their causes, we are enabled to classify and retain in the memory a multitude of complicated relations — the various peculiarities of national character. More deeply can we understand the different degrees of moral and intellectual refinement, and numerous other circumstances. Without historical associations, these would be uninteresting or imperfectly understood. The present condition of nations is the result of many previous changes. Some are extremely remote, and others recent, some gradual, others sudden and violent. In a similar way, the state of the natural world is the result of a long succession of events. If we seek to enlarge our experience of the present inner workings of nature, we must investigate the effects of her operations in past eras.  \n"
"> \n"
"> On looking back into the history of nations, we often discover with surprise how the outcome of some battle has influenced the fate of millions today. This remote event may be connected to the current geo- graphical boundaries of a great state, the language now spoken by the inhabitants, their peculiar manners, laws, and religious opinions. But far more astonishing and unexpected are the connections brought to light when we dig deeper into the history of nature. The form of a coast, the layout of the interior of a country, the existence and extent of lakes, valleys, and mountains, can often be traced to earthquakes and volcanoes in regions which are now tranquil. These ancient upheavals are the reason why some lands are fertile, and others are sterile. They determine the elevation of land above the sea, the climate, and various peculiarities.  \n"
"> \n"
"> On the other hand, much of the Earth’s surface was formed by slow operations such as the gradual depositing of sediment in a lake or in the ocean, or to a great increase of testacea and corals.  \n"
"> \n"
"> To select another example, we find in certain areas underground deposits of coal, consisting of vegetable matter which drifted into what were formerly seas and lakes. These seas and lakes have since been filled up. The lands the forests once grew upon have disappeared or changed their form, the rivers and currents which floated the vegetable masses can no longer be traced. And the plants belonged to species which have passed away from the surface of our planet ages ago. Yet the wealth and numerical strength of a nation may now be mainly dependent on the distribution of fuel determined by that ancient state of things.  \n"
"> \n"
"> Geology is closely related to almost all the physical sciences, as history is to the moral. A historian should, if possible, be at once profoundly acquainted with ethics, politics, jurisprudence, the military art, theology; in a word, with all branches of knowledge by which any insight into human affairs, or into the moral and intellectual nature of man, can be obtained. Likewise, a geologist should be well versed in chemistry, natural philosophy, mineralogy, zoology, comparative anatomy, botany; in short, in every science relating to organic and inorganic nature.  \n"
"> \n"
"> With these accomplishments, the historian and geologist would rarely fail to draw correct and philosophical conclusions from the various monuments brought to them by former events. They would know what combination of causes similar effects were relatable to. And they would often be abled to infer information concerning many events unrecorded in the archives of former ages.  \n"
"> \n"
"> But since no one individual can be expert in so many subjects, it is necessary that men who have devoted their lives to different departments should unite their efforts. The historian receives assistance from experts on ancient times and from scholars of moral and political science. In the same way, the geologist should avail himself of the aid of many naturalists. He should particularly gain the help of those who have studied the fossil remains of lost species of animals and plants.  \n"
"> \n"
"> To be fair, we can only compare one class of historical monuments to the records studied in geology — those which unintentionally mark past events. The canoes, for example, and stone hatchets found in our peat bogs, inform us about the arts and manners of the earliest inhabitants."

msgid "[[☃ image 1]] Charles Lyell (1797 — 1875) was a British lawyer and the foremost geologist of his day. He is best known as the author of _Principles of Geology_. It popularized geologist James Hutton’s concept of “uniformitarianism” — the idea that the Earth was shaped by slow-moving forces still in operation today. Uniformitarian ideas opposed the common belief among many geologists that unique catastrophes or supernatural events, like the biblical flood in the story of Noah, shaped Earth’s surface. The motto of uniformitarianism was “the present is the key to the past.” Lyell’s friend, Charles Darwin, took that idea and extended it to biology."

"> ## Observing light and waves  \n"
"> \n"
"> “Here it is demonstrated how the Moon, not having any light of its own but the light which it takes from the Sun, could not take nor reflect it if it had not a dense and lustrous surface like surfaces of mirrors and liquids; but were it of the nature of dense and lustrous mirror, it would give us only part of all the light, as if the eye which looks at it were situated in the point a, and such a thing would make very small light. But if its lustre originates from a liquid body, the reflected rays would not lose their character nor their great brightness; but if it is wavy, as we see for ourselves happening in the marine waters, then the brightness will convey itself to each single wave on its own account, and then all together will cause a great quantity of brightness, but not so powerfully as originally, on account of the shady parts that the waves possess.” (Codex Leicester, Folio 1 R)\n"
"> \n"
"> ## Shells in the mountains  \n"
"> \n"
"> “If you will say that the shells, which are visible in our times within the borders of Italy, far from the seas, at such a great height, were caused by the Deluge, which left them there, I reply that if you believe that the Deluge was 7 cubits higher than the highest mountain, as he who measured it wrote, these shells, which always reside near to the sea shores, ought to remain on those mountains, and not so low as the feet of the mountains, every one at the same height, stratum by stratum. And if you will say that these shells are inclined to stay near the seashores, and that, as the water rises at such a height, the shells depart from their first location and follow the increase of the waters up to their greatest height, here it is replied that, since the shell, an animal, has no faster motion than the land snail when it is out of the water, it will be even slower, since it does not swim but rather it makes a fur- row in the sand and by means of the sides of this furrow, on which it leans, it will walk between 3 to 4 braccia a day; thus, with this motion, it could not walk from the Adriatic Sea to the Monferrato in Lombardy, which is a distance of 250 miles, in 40 days, as he, who kept a calculation of this time, said. And if you say that the waves carried the shells there, because of their weight they cannot be supported except on the sea bed; and if you do not grant me this, at least acknowledge that they had to remain on the tops of the highest mountains, and in the lakes that are shut among the mountains, such as the lake of Lario, and the Maggiore and of Como, and of Fiesole, and of Perugia and similar.” (Codex Leicester, Folio 8 V)\n"
"> \n"
"> ## Underground water and a moving Earth  \n"
"> \n"
"> “The heat of the fire burning within the center of the Earth warms the waters which are enclosed within the great caverns and other concavities; and this heat causes the aforesaid waters to be warmed and evaporated, and they raise themselves up to the roofs of the aforesaid concavities, and penetrate through the fissures of the mountains, up to their greatest heights, where, as it finds the cold, it suddenly changes back into water, as it is seen happen in the still, and it falls down and forms the beginning of the rivers, which are subsequently seen descending from there. But when great coldness pushes back the heat toward the center of the world, this heat becomes more powerful and gives rise to greater evaporation of the aforesaid waters; and these evaporations, heating the caverns in which they circulate, cannot produce the waters as they used to, as it is seen in the making of aqua vitae, for if the passage for the evaporation of wine did not pass through cool water, the said evaporation would never change into aqua vitae, but would return and finally it would condense to such an extent that it would break every obstacle. We will say the same of water heated in the bowels of the earth, which not finding in its passage places of such coolness as are adapted for it, does not form itself into water as it did before, but it condenses and congeals like the fire multiplied and condensed within a bombard, which makes itself harder and more powerful than the matter that receives it, and so, unless it has a sudden exhalation, it immediately proceeds to break and destroy that which opposes its growth; so does the aforesaid evaporation of water, and it bursts within the bowels of the earth in different places, revolving and rumbling with great tumult; it finally reaches the surface of the Earth, which with a great earthquake shakes the regions and often ruins the mountains and collapses the cities and intervening lands in various parts, and it emerges with great wind through the breaks previously made in the earth; and so, by this exhalation, it consumes its own power.” (Codex Leicester, Folio 28 R)"

msgid "[[☃ image 1]]Leonardo da Vinci (1452 — 1519) was a multi-talented Italian scholar who gave meaning to the term “Renaissance man.” He was a painter, architect, mathematician, inventor, engineer, and more. The Codex Leicester is one of da Vinci’s 30 scientific journals and takes the form of 18 sheets of paper, folded in half with writing on both sides — 72 pages of writing in total. The Codex is named for the Earl of Leicester, Thomas Coke, who acquired it in 1717\\. In the Codex, da Vinci notes his observations about astronomy, the movement of water, light, fossils, and geologic formations. The creative thinking process of a scientist is on display as da Vinci argues, probes, and accumulates information on which to base claims."

msgid "All of sudden Ray disappeared. He vanished so quickly I couldn’t understand what had happened, as if a magician had touched him with a wand. Puzzled, I looked again ahead of me along the rope. I realized he hadn’t entirely disappeared. Rather, Ray had suddenly become really short. Only his head and shoulders poked above the glacier’s shimmering surface. I now understood that he’d fallen into a crevasse. His legs dangled underneath him in a deep crack in the glacier that probably dropped far down toward volcanic depths below."

msgid "As you may know, the Earth is a ball of hot, molten rock and minerals covered by the thin outer “crust” of cooled rock on which we live. Giant “plates” of this cooled crust float like rafts or islands over the molten ball of the Earth’s interior. In perpetual — but very slow — motion, most of the plates move only about one inch per year. (In other words, we’re all lava surfing...very, very slowly.) But where they meet along the plate edges, all sorts of crazy things occur. The huge plates scrape past each other sideways. They dive under each other. And in places the constantly moving plates get snagged on each other causing tremendous pressures to build. When this tension suddenly releases, things happen way, way, way faster than one inch per year."

It looked like another planet extending in the far distance — rippled plains of solidified lava, a strip of desert where sand and dust blew in the gale, huge glacial sheets, distant mountains. At our feet, below us, lay a small blue lake sparkling in the sun surrounded by hillsides of reddish earth and patches of glacial ice. Everywhere around the lake steam sprung from the Earth — from the hillsides, from the shores, from steaming vents in the glacier itself."

It was difficult to see from below just how active it might be above. We hired a young man from a nearby village who could lead us to the top. Off we went in the rainy darkness before dawn, clambering for hours through dripping, misty rainforest. Finally, the green rainforest ended and we topped out at nearly 10,000 feet on the broad, ashy-gray summit that looked like the surface of the Moon and was scattered with big gray boulders."

I learned Iceland sits directly atop a giant seam where two plates are not colliding or diving but spreading apart. Known as the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, here lava wells between two plates adding to their edges and creating a string of undersea volcanoes. Iceland is where some of the volcanoes rise above the Atlantic Ocean but it lies so near the North Pole that glaciers cover parts of it. Thus our goal: to reach a spot where volcanic fire mingled with glacial ice."

Far in the center of the island, the fire and ice — the glaciers and volcanoes — mix together in dramatic and sometimes explosive fashion. Getting to that spot became the goal of our trip.

Centers of continents, like the center of a raft, tend to be more stable than a subduction zone on a coast. But not always. I live with my family in the interior of the North American Plate, in Missoula, Montana. This is not so far from Yellowstone Park. All those famous geysers are actually boiling up from a “hot spot” where a massive bubble of lava pushes close to the Earth’s surface from deep beneath the crust and boils water that’s flowing underground. The North American Plate is sliding over that huge lava dome. (I’m lava surfing even while I’m writing this.) Over millions of years, as the Rocky Mountains slid over the Yellowstone Hot Spot, it melted and crumbled a wide channel right through the mountain ranges, like a hot pan melting lumps of butter, and snow and rain flowed off the Rockies into the channel to form a river."

msgid "Then I looked back around me at the big boulders lying on the summit plateau. I had assumed they'd lain there for years, if not centuries, since the last big eruption. I now noticed that they'd made craters in the ash, disturbing the rain-pocked surface. Right then I realized that the volcano had erupted just since that morning with its lava bombs falling out of the sky onto the summit. It was more than active - it was really active - and it felt like we were standing beside a direct hole down to the molten interior of the Earth."

msgid "This channel both helped and nearly killed early European explorers of the West. Trying to find a pass through the Rocky Mountains to reach the Pacific Ocean, they got funneled into this channel — today called the Snake River Valley — and paddled their canoes down its river. Too late, they discovered that the river eventually left the channel and flowed straight into an ancient ocean trench, now on dry land, created by the Pacific Plate diving under the North American Plate and then cut deeper by the river. Huge rapids smashed the explorers’ canoes and trapped them in the canyon bottom. Here they nearly starved to death."

Maps tell amazing stories of the Earth's dynamic and often-violent history, and plate tectonics is a kind of language to read the stories hidden in maps."

There was the most incredible hole in the Earth I'd ever seen, as wide across as several soccer fields and impossibly deep, falling far away to a bottom I couldn't see. Every 20 or 30 seconds a huge gray huffy blast of foul-smelling smoke and steam and ash came belching out of that rocky shaft and billowed past our faces into the sky. It made me dizzy to look over the rim."

msgid "Why that arcing trench? Plate tectonics taught me that Indonesia's necklace of islands traces a distinct seam in the Earth's crust where two huge plates collide. The Australian Plate is shoving northward at five centimeters per year and diving beneath — subducting — under the Eurasian Plate. This diving creates a deep crease in the Earth’s crust, the Sunda Trench. As the Australian Plate dives and melts into the Earth’s interior, it allows lava to well up to the surface in a necklace of active volcanoes along the seam, one of them the belching vent of our Mount Marapi. You can imagine how that the incredible pressure of two plates colliding shakes Indonesia with near-constant earthquakes, small and large, and occasional mega-quakes, like the 2004 undersea quake and tsunami off Sumatra."

msgid "Once you have reviewed the rubric, read “Early Earth.” When you’ve finished reading the essay, evaluate it using the blank version of the rubric, which is attached to the Writing Rubric document. Focus on one category at a time and take the following approach: Reread the general description of the category—the column furthest to the left. Then, reread the descriptions of each standard for that category. Decide which standard for the category you think best describes the essay. Once you decide, mark the appropriate box on the rubric with an “X” and write a brief comment somewhere in that row—it can be on either side of the “X.”"

The Romans would later adopt silver as one of their main currencies as well."

msgid "But did you know that billions of years ago there was no silver anywhere in the Universe? So where did it come from? Like most other elements in the periodic table, silver was created in dying stars — and in the cataclysmic supernova explosions that sometimes marked their final demise. This is the only place where temperatures get hot enough to fuse hydrogen nuclei together to form larger atoms. These larger, heavier atoms eventually went on to help form planets like Earth. So in a sense, silver, like everything else around you, was made from the first atoms of hydrogen. Where and when was hydrogen created? In the Big Bang itself."

msgid "Silver helped advance global civilization by connecting East and West through trade. Silver was scarce in China, but nonetheless much valued as currency. So, during the Middle Ages, Europeans used silver to buy Chinese goods — gunpowder, tea, ceramics, and silk — which were then carried over the fabled “Silk Road.” Later, when the Spanish discovered silver mines in Mexico and Peru, they established a sailing route across the Pacific, trading South American silver, some of it plundered, for Chinese silk. Silk was desirable because it made light and cool clothing much in demand by Spanish settlers in the hot, humid climate in parts of Mexico, Central America, and South America. As we’ll see elsewhere in this course, when goods get traded, so do ideas. So silver played a role in advancing collective learning."

Thought to be perhaps the oldest coin, the “Lydian Lion” was minted in modern-day Turkey some 2,700 years ago; early metalworkers — chemists of sorts — made the coins from electrum, an alloy of gold and silver. The Minoan civilization, which flourished on the island of Crete around 2000 BCE, and the Mycenaean people of early mainland Greece imported great amounts of silver mined in ancient Armenia. Transport of the metal between all of these places helped to accelerate trade throughout the Mediterranean region."

For each of these thresholds, there are a set of ingredients and a set of Goldilocks Conditions that result in new complexities. In this activity, you’ll explore the concept of thresholds in greater depth. First, you’ll look at the threshold card for Threshold 2\\.

msgid "In the Hertzsprung-Russell Diagram, the luminosities (brightnesses) of stars are plotted against their temperatures. The position of a star in the diagram demonstrates its present stage and its mass. Stars that fuse hydrogen into helium lie on the central diagonal branch, the so-called \"main sequence.\" Red dwarfs like AB Doradus C lie in the cool and faint corner.  When a star exhausts all if its hydrogen, it leaves the main sequence and becomes a red giant or a supergiant, depending on its mass. When medium-sized stars with masses similar to our Sun age, they will swell in size and become red giants. Without enough mass to cause a supernova, they will burn all of their fuel and eventually shrink into white dwarfs (seen in the lower left)."

But this planetary nebula represents a late stage of stellar evolution that our Sun should experience several billion years from now. When a star like the Sun begins to run out of fuel it becomes a red giant, eventually leaving behind a hot core that collapses to form a dense white dwarf star. In this case, a fast wind emanating from the hot core rams into the ejected atmosphere, pushed it outward, and creates the cocoon-like structure seen here. In less than a million years, NGC 6543 will collapse, becoming a less dramatic white dwarf."

In 1870, German chemist Julius Lothar Meyer published a paper describing the same organization of elements as Mendeleev’s. Both scientists had similar backgrounds: They had studied in Heidelberg, Germany, in the laboratory of the chemist Robert Bunsen. Both had attended, in September 1860, the first international chemistry congress in Karlsruhe, Germany. The congress had addressed the need to establish a common system to measure the weights of the different elements. And both chemists were teachers working on textbooks for their students."

But a century later, they still used a variety of symbols and acronyms to represent the different materials — there just wasn’t a common lexicon. In 1869, the Russian chemist Dmitri Mendeleev came to prominence with his tabular diagram of known elements. This basic ingredient list, of which all matter exists, became known as the periodic table. Here’s what’s especially amazing: Mendeleev’s chart allotted spaces for elements that were yet to be discovered. For some of these missing pieces, he predicted what their atomic masses and other chemical properties would be. When scientists later discovered the elements Mendeleev expected, the world got a glimpse of the brilliance behind the periodic table."

The elements are arranged in a series of rows called “periods,” so that those with similar properties appear in vertical columns. Each vertical column is called a “group,” or family, of elements. This instantly shows one set of relationships when read up and down, and another when read from side to side. Some groups have elements sharing very similar properties, such as their appearance and their behavior. For example, each element has its own melting and boiling point, the temperatures at which it changes from a solid to a liquid and from a liquid to a gas. Another characteristic is how “reactive” an element is, meaning how quick it is to join up with other elements. Scientists recognize how an element will react based on its location on the table."

Periodic table creator Dmitri Mendeleev and other scientists had insisted that the atom was the smallest unit in matter, but the English physicist J. J. Thompson, responding to X-ray research, concluded that certain rays were made up of particles even smaller than atoms. The work of Thompson and Curie contributed to the work of New Zealand–born British scientist Ernest Rutherford, a Thompson protégé who, in 1899, distinguished two different kinds of particles emanating from radioactive substances: “beta” rays, which traveled nearly at the speed of light and could penetrate thick barriers, and the slower, heavier “alpha” rays."

Nevertheless, Maria graduated from high school when she was 15 with top grades.

msgid "When Maria registered at the Sorbonne, she signed her name as “Marie,” and worked hard to learn French. Of 1,800 students there, only 23 were women. Many people still believed that women should not be studying science, but Marie was a dedicated student. She rented a small space in an attic and often studied late into the night. In 1893, Marie took an exam to get her degree in physics, a branch of science that studies natural laws, and passed, with the highest marks in her class. She was the first woman to earn a degree in physics from the Sorbonne."

Pierre helped her find an unused shed behind the Sorbonne’s School of Physics and Chemistry. There, Marie put the pitchblende in huge pots, stirred and cooked it, and ground it into powder. She added chemicals to the substance and tried to isolate all the elements in it. Every day she mixed a boiling mass with a heavy iron rod nearly as large as herself."

That quest for knowledge required an understanding of chemical processes, and while alchemy itself would not survive the Enlightenment (the Age of Reason of the 17th and 18th centuries), the quest it began continues today in chemistry. To understand the ever-evolving field of chemistry, which is sometimes called “the central science” because it connects natural sciences like physics, geology, and biology, it’s critical to grasp its beginnings."

Paracelsus believed that the body’s organs worked alchemically, that is, their function was to separate the impure from the pure, and proposed that a balance of three controlling substances (mercury, sulfur, and salt), which he called the “tria prima,” was necessary for maintaining health. Paracelsus treated the plague and other diseases with an alchemical approach that included administering inorganic salts, minerals, and metals. He believed that what he called the “alkahest,” the supposed universal solvent, was the philosopher’s stone but had no interest in the transmutation of metals, writing, “Many have said of Alchemy, that it is for the making of gold and silver. For me such is not the aim, but to consider only what virtue and power may lie in medicines.”"

msgid "Among the most significant of the post-alchemic chemists were the French nobleman Antoine-Laurent Lavoisier (1743–1794) and the Russian chemist Dmitri Mendeleev (1834–1907). In 1789, Lavoisier wrote the first comprehen- sive chemistry textbook, and, like Robert Boyle, he is often referred to as the father of modern chemistry. Lavoisier agreed with Boyle that Aristotle’s four-elements theory was mistaken, and in his textbook, he compiled a list of metallic and nonmetallic elements that would point toward the periodic table developed by Mendeleev in 1869\\. It was Mendeleev who demonstrated that the elements could be arranged in a periodic — regular and recurring — relationship to each other based on their atomic weights and who created a periodic table that could accurately predict the properties of elements that had yet to be discovered. Mendeleev’s table is still used today."

msgid "Islamic Arabs took over Alexandria in the seventh century CE, and as the center of learning shifted to Damascus and the newly founded Baghdad, alchemical texts were translated from Greek to Arabic. An eminent figure at that time was Jabir ibn Hayyan (721–815, although some sources say he never existed), who became a royal alchemist in Baghdad. Jabir’s writings were the first to mention such important compounds as corrosive sublimate (mercuric chloride), red oxide of mercury (mercuric oxide), and silver nitrate. Like Aristotle, Jabir believed metals grew in the Earth, adding to Aristotelian theory the notion that metals were differentiated by how much mercury and sulfur they contained. Making gold thus required the purification of these ingredients. Scholars in the West first learned about alchemy in roughly the 12th and 13th centuries as they copied and translated Arabic texts into Latin. Medieval science was still dominated by the ideas of Aristotle."

msgid "The origins of alchemy are difficult to track down. In the East, in India and China, alchemy started sometime before the Common Era (CE) with meditation and medicine designed to purify the spirit and body and to thereby achieve immortality. In the West, alchemy probably evolved from Egyptian metallurgy as far back as the fourth millennium BCE. The ideas of Aristotle (384–322 BCE), who proposed that all matter was composed of the four “elements” — earth, air, fire, and water — began to influence alchemical practices when his student Alexander the Great (356–323 BCE) established Alexandria as a center of learning. Alexander is said by some to have discovered the Greek god Hermes’s famous _Emerald Tablet_, reputed to contain the secret of the philosopher’s stone, and to have built the Library of Alexandria specifically to house alchemical texts. These texts were, however, almost entirely destroyed in the third century, and soon thereafter the Alexandrian Zosimus wrote what are now the oldest known books on alchemy, which emphasize its mysticism rather than its medical or practical applications."

For this and other important contributions to scientific inquiry, Boyle is sometimes called the father of modern chemistry, but he was not a scientist in the current sense of the word. Rather, he is what is called a natural philosopher, someone who studied fundamental questions about nature and the physical universe before the 19th century, when dramatic advances in technology began to revolutionize our understanding of and approach to these questions."

But if you don’t care how it’s arranged you can just let it un-tidy itself naturally.

Then imagine opening the gates of the dam and allowing the water to flow downhill. Now you have energy flowing — enough to drive a turbine that can create the electricity to power a computer. Now more complex things can happen."

msgid "One of the central themes of this course is the idea of increasing complexity. In the 13.8 billion years since our Universe appeared, more and more complex things seem to have appeared — and we’re among the most complex of them all. So it’s natural for complex things to fascinate us. Besides, modern human society is so complex that learning how the Universe creates complexity can also teach us something about today’s world. But we shouldn’t assume there’s anything special about complexity or that complex things are necessarily any better than simple things. Remember that complexity can present challenges."

msgid "Before modern science came along our ancestors were not aware of the physical universality that ties all of nature together. Nevertheless, our ancestors were just as interested in finding connections as we are. The main way in which they brought coherence to their experience of things and events was to tell stories about them. These stories often took the form of myths about cosmic, biological, and human origins. Understanding the origin of things apparently reduces human anxiety in the face of the unknown."

Since religions are so central to the history of human existence on our planet, they rightly attract the interest of natural scientists and not just of historians and theologians. Any objective survey of big history, therefore, cannot ignore the dominant role that religions have played in shaping the consciousness of most people who have ever lived."

Or, if you develop a sense of big history, can you still honestly accept the teachings of your faith tradition if you have one? Does belief in God, for example, contradict science, as many educated people now maintain? Isn’t it hard to be both a serious scientist and a person of faith?

Science now allows us to tell a whole new story about our connection to nature. Remarkably, over the last two centuries the natural sciences have increasingly demonstrated that the Universe itself has a history and that human life is a relatively new chapter in the cosmic story. We did not float in from some other world. We blossomed gradually from roots that extend all the way back to the Big Bang.

Since the beginning of human existence on our planet, most people have asked questions of a religious nature. For example, what happens to the dead? Are they somehow still connected to the world of the living? In his insightful book _The Broken Connection_, psychiatrist Robert Jay Lifton observes that in the scientific age the bonds our ancestors felt between the living and dead have been weakened or completely broken. Scientifically educated people now often question the connection that religions professed to find between our present life and a wider world of sacred mystery."

"> In the beginning there was Chaos, a yawning nothingness. Out of the void emerged Gaia (the Earth) and other divine beings — Eros (love), the Abyss (part of the underworld), and the Erebus (the unknowable place where death dwells). Without male assistance, Gaia gave birth to Uranus (the Sky), who then fertilized her.\n"
"> \n"
"> From that union the first Titans were born — six males: Coeus, Crius, Cronus, Hyperion, Iapetus, and Oceanus, and six females: Mnemosyne, Phoebe, Rhea, Theia, Themis, and Tethys. After Cronus (time) was born, Gaia and Uranus decreed no more Titans were to be born.\n"
"> \n"
"> Cronus castrated his father and threw the severed genitals into the sea, from which arose Aphrodite, goddess of love, beauty and sexuality. Cronus became the ruler of the gods with his sister-wife, Rhea, as his consort. The other Titans became his court. Because Cronus had betrayed his father, he feared that his offspring would do the same. So each time Rhea gave birth, Cronus snatched up the child and ate it. Rhea hated this and tricked him by hiding one child, Zeus, and wrapping a stone in a baby’s blanket so that Cronus ate the stone instead of the baby.\n"
"> \n"
"> When Zeus was grown, he fed his father a drugged drink, which caused Cronus to vomit, throwing up Rhea’s other children and the stone. Zeus then challenged Cronus to war for the kingship of the gods. At last Zeus and his siblings, the Olympians, were victorious, and the Titans were hurled down to imprisonment in the Abyss.\n"
"> \n"
"> Zeus was plagued by the same concern as his father had been and, after a prophecy that his first wife, Metis, would give birth to a god greater than he, he swallowed Metis. But she was already pregnant with Athena, and they both made him miserable until Athena, the goddess of wisdom, civilization and justice, burst from his head — fully grown and dressed for war. Zeus was able to fight off all challenges to his power and to remain the ruler of Mt. Olympus, the home of the gods.\n"
"> \n"
"> One son of Titans, Prometheus, did not fight with fellow Titans against Zeus and was spared imprisonment; he was given the task of creating man. Prometheus shaped man out of mud, and Athena breathed life into the clay figure. Prometheus made man stand upright as the gods did and gave him fire. Prometheus tricked Zeus, and to punish him, Zeus created Pandora, the first woman, of stunning beau- ty, wealth, and a deceptive heart and lying tongue. He also gave Pandora a box she was commanded never to open, but eventually her curiosity got the best of her, and she opened the box to release all kinds of evil, plagues, sorrows, and misfortunes, and also hope, which lay at the bottom of the box."

msgid "[[☃ image 1]]We know the Greek origin story from some of the earliest Greek literary sources that have survived, namely _The Theogony and Works and Days_, by Hesiod. This oral poet is thought to have been active sometime between 750 and 650 BCE, within decades of when the Homeric epics, The _Iliad_ and _The Odyssey_, took the form in which we know them. Archeological findings support the creation story recorded in Hesiod’s work; pottery from the eighth century BCE depicts the gods and goddesses he describes. Before Hesiod told this patriarchal version, in which the first woman is the cause of much trouble, Pandora, whose name means “gift giver,” was known in oral tradition as a beneficent Earth goddess."

"> The first people lived beyond the sky because there was no earth beneath. The chief’s daughter became ill, and no cure could be found. A wise old man told them to dig up a tree and lay the girl beside the hole. People began to dig, but as they did the tree fell right through the hole, dragging the girl with it.\n"
"> \n"
"> Below lay an endless sheet of water where two swans floated. As the swans looked up, they saw the sky break and a strange tree fall down into the water. Then they saw the girl fall after it. They swam to her and supported her, because she was too beautiful to allow her to drown. Then they swam to the Great Turtle, master of all the animals, who at once called a council.\n"
"> \n"
"> When all the animals had arrived, the Great Turtle told them that the appearance of a woman from the sky was a sign of good fortune. Since the tree had earth on its roots, he asked them to find where it had sunk and bring up some of the earth to put on his back, to make an island for the woman to live on.\n"
"> \n"
"> The swans led the animals to the place where the tree had fallen. First Otter, then Muskrat, and then Beaver dived. As each one came up from the great depths, he rolled over exhausted and died. Many other animals tried, but they experienced the same fate.\n"
"> \n"
"> At last the old lady Toad volunteered. She was under so long that the others thought she had been lost. But at last she came to the surface and before dying managed to spit out a mouthful of dirt on the back of the Great Turtle.\n"
"> \n"
"> It was magical earth and had the power of growth. As soon as it was as big as an island, the woman was set down on it. The two white swans circled it, while it continued to grow, until, at last, it became the world island as it is today, supported in the great waters on the back of the Turtle."

"> In the beginning when God created the heavens and the earth, the earth was a formless void, and darkness was over the surface of the deep, and the Spirit of God was hovering over the waters. And God said, “Let there be light,” and there was light. God saw that the light was good, and he separated the light from the darkness. God called the light “day,” and the darkness he called “night.” And there was evening, and there was morning — the first day.\n"
"> \n"
"> And God said, “Let there be a dome between the waters to separate water from water.” So God made the dome and separated the water under the dome from the water above it. And it was so. God called the dome “sky.” And there was evening, and there was morning — the second day.\n"
"> \n"
"> And God said, “Let the water under the sky be gathered to one place, and let dry ground appear.” And it was so. God called the dry ground “land,” and the gathered waters he called “seas.” And God saw that it was good. Then God said, “Let the land produce vegetation: seed-bearing plants and trees on the land that bear fruit with seed in it, of every kind.” And it was so. The land produced vegetation: plants bearing seed of every kind and trees bearing fruit with seed in it of every kind. And God saw that it was good. And there was evening, and there was morning — the third day.\n"
"> \n"
"> And God said, “Let there be lights in the dome of the sky to separate the day from the night, and let them serve as signs to mark sacred times, and days and years, and let them be lights in the dome of the sky to give light on the earth.” And it was so. God made two great lights — the greater light to govern the day and the lesser light to govern the night. He also made the stars. God set them in the dome of the sky to give light on the earth, to govern the day and the night, and to separate light from darkness. And God saw that it was good. And there was evening, and there was morning — the fourth day.\n"
"> \n"
"> And God said, “Let the water teem with living creatures, and let birds fly above the earth across the dome of the sky.” So God created the great creatures of the sea and every living thing of every kind that moves in the teeming water, and every winged bird of every kind. And God saw that it was good. God blessed them and said, “Be fruitful and increase in number and fill the water in the seas, and let the birds increase on the earth.” And there was evening, and there was morning — the fifth day. \n"
"> \n"
"> And God said, “Let the land produce living creatures of every kind: the livestock, the creatures that move along the ground, and the wild ani- mals, each of every kind.” And it was so. God made the wild animals of every kind, the livestock of every kind, and all the creatures that move along the ground of every kind. And God saw that it was good.\n"
"> \n"
"> Then God said, “Let us make humankind in our image, in our likeness, so that they may rule over the fish in the sea and the birds in the sky, over the livestock and all the wild animals, and over all the creatures that move along the ground.”\n"
"> \n"
"> So God created humankind in his own image, in the image of God he created them; male and female he created them. God blessed them and said to them, “Be fruitful and increase in number; fill the earth and subdue it. Rule over the fish in the sea and the birds in the sky and over every living creature that moves on the ground.”\n"
"> \n"
"> Then God said, “I give you every seed-bearing plant on the face of the whole earth and every tree that has fruit with seed in it. They will be yours for food. And to all the beasts of the earth and all the birds in the sky and all the creatures that move along the ground — everything that has the breath of life in it — I give every green plant for food.” And it was so. God saw all that he had made, and it was very good. And there was evening, and there was morning — the sixth day.\n"
"> \n"
"> Thus the heaven and the earth were finished, with all their multitudes. And on the seventh day God rested from all the work that he had done in creation. God blessed the seventh day and hallowed it because on it God rested from all the work that he had done in creation."

In Genesis this story is followed immediately by a second creation story, in which humans are created first, followed by plants and animals. These stories were written down in the first millennium BCE and evolved into the form in which we know them around 450 BCE, some 2460 years ago."

"> Now it still ripples, now it still murmurs, still sighs, and is empty under the sky. There is not yet one person, not one animal, bird, fish or tree. There is only the sky alone; the face of earth is not clear, only the sea alone is pooled under all the sky. Whatever might be is simply not there.\n"
"> \n"
"> There were makers in the sea, together called the Plumed Serpent. There were makers in the sky, together called the Heart of Sky. Together these makers planned the dawn of life.\n"
"> \n"
"> The earth arose because of them. It was simply their word that brought it forth. It arose suddenly, like a cloud unfolding. Then the mountains were separated from the water. All at once great mountains came forth. The sky was set apart, and the earth was set apart in the midst of the waters.\n"
"> \n"
"> Then the makers in the sky planned the animals of the mountains — the deer, pumas, jaguars, rattlesnakes, and guardians of the bushes. Then they established the nests of the birds, great and small. “You precious birds; your nests are in the trees and bushes.” Then the deer and birds were told to talk to praise their makers, to pray to them. But the birds and animals did not talk; they just squawked and howled. So they had to accept that their flesh would be eaten by others.\n"
"> \n"
"> The makers tried again to form a giver of respect, a creature who would nurture and provide. They made a body from mud, but it didn’t look good. It talked at first but then crumbled and disintegrated into the water.\n"
"> \n"
"> Then the Heart of Sky called on the wise ones, the diviners, the Grandfather Xpiyacoc and the Grandmother Xmucane, to help decide how to form a person. The Grandparents said it is well to make wooden carvings, human in looks and speech. So wooden humans came into being; they talked and multiplied, but there was nothing in their minds and hearts, no memory of their builder, no memory of Heart of Sky.\n"
"> \n"
"> Then there came a great destruction. The wooden carvings were killed when the Heart of Sky devised a flood for them. It rained all day and all night. The animals came into the homes of the wooden carvings and ate them. The people were overthrown. The monkeys in the forest are a sign of this. They look like the previous people — mere wooden carvings.\n"
"> \n"
"> The story continues with the final people being made from corn, an important crop that enabled the Mayan people to move from being a hunting-and-gathering society to a more complex civilization."

"> In the beginning, as far as we know, there was nothing. Suddenly, from a single point, all the energy in the Universe burst forth. Since that moment 13.8 billion years ago, the Universe has been expanding — and cooling down as it gets bigger. \n"
"> \n"
"> Gradually energy cooled enough to become matter. One electron could stay in orbit around one proton to become an atom of hydrogen. Great clouds of hydrogen swirled around space until gravity pulled some atoms so close together that they began to burn as stars. Stars swirled together in giant clusters called galaxies; now there are galaxies numbering in the billions.\n"
"> \n"
"> After each star burned up all its matter, it died in a huge explosion. The explosion generated so much heat that some atoms fused and got more and more complex, forming many different elements, including gold and silver.\n"
"> \n"
"> One giant star, our mother star, exploded and scattered clouds of gas containing all the elements needed to form living beings. About 5 billion years ago gravity pulled these atoms into a new star: our Sun. The leftover pieces of matter stuck to each other and formed eight planets, which revolve around the Sun.\n"
"> \n"
"> The third planet out, Earth, became our home. It was the perfect size — not too big, not too small — and the perfect distance from the Sun, not too far or too close. A thin crust formed over Earth’s hot interior, and the temperature was just right for water to form on parts of the surface. Gradually the chemicals in the water formed inside of membranes and got more complex until one-celled living organisms appeared, able to maintain themselves and reproduce.\n"
"> \n"
"> For 3 billion years these one-celled creatures reproduced almost exactly, but not quite. They gradually changed in response to their environment.\n"
"> \n"
"> But they also changed their environment. They learned to burn energy from the Sun, and they released oxygen into the atmosphere. The oxygen formed an ozone layer around Earth that protected life from the Sun’s rays.\n"
"> \n"
"> Eventually cells stuck together to form creatures with many cells. Plants and animals came out of the sea onto land and became ever more complex and aware, until about 100,000 years ago human beings evolved from a shared ancestor with species of apes.\n"
"> \n"
"> Humans could talk in symbols and sing, dance, draw, and cooperate more than the other animals could. Humans learned to write and to accumulate their learning so that it kept expanding. Humans increased in skills and in numbers until there were too many people and too few big animals in some places.\n"
"> \n"
"> Then humans learned to grow their own food and herd their own animals. Some animals learned to cooperate with humans. This gave humans new sources of food and work energy, and they could live in larger and larger groups. These groups expanded into cities and empires, using more and more of the resources of Earth. Humans collaborated and learned collectively in more complex ways; they traveled, traded, and exchanged inventions, creating vast civilizations of astonishing beauty and complexity.\n"
"> \n"
"> Humans were always looking for more energy for their use. About 200 years ago we learned to use the energy from coal — trees that grew more than 300,000 years ago, then were buried underground. Humans learned to burn oil — animal remains buried long ago under the sea. Using these fossil fuels, humans began to change their climate quickly, as the gases released from burning these fuels ascended into the atmosphere.\n"
"> \n"
"> Now humans are in a predicament – our population is increasing rapidly, fossil fuels are running out, we are pushing many plants and other animals into extinction, and we are changing the climate. What are we humans going to do next?"

When they arrived, they discovered over 800 giant statues and almost no people. This was strange, since the small number of people on the island couldn’t possibly have built these statues—it would have taken a much larger civilization. Think about Easter Island and consider the following questions: What kinds of events might have befallen the people of Easter Island?
