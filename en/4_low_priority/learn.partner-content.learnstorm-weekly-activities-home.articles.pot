Everybody at school used to make fun at me. I persevered, with still no luck. I kept on trying, but it still didn't work. I realized that I should probably ask someone on how to catch a football, I needed an expert. I asked my older brother and he was happy to help. We went in the backyard and had hours of practice. After a few days of practice I could finally catch the football! This showed me I could really learn something with help and practice."
