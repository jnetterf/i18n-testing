msgid "This indicates that the asset land has increased by $10,000 and that the asset cash has decreased by $10,000.  The counterintuitive use of a debit corresponding to an increase in an asset is due to the origins of accounting in the latin language.  In the original bookkeeping invented by Pacioli (Wikipedia link or similar), increases in assets were written on the left hand side of the tablet or book – in latin, left is translated as debito, which is abbreviated as Debit or “Dr”.  Decreases in assets were written on the right side – translated as credito in latin, and often abbreviated as credit or “Cr”.  The journal, which is sometimes called the general journal is an important document within the accounting system.  It must be updated whenever a business event (termed a transaction) occurs.  It summarizes the understanding of the transaction which the manager arrived at in stage 1.  The journal also forms the raw material for the remaining stages of the accounting cycle."

msgid "The main principle of transaction analysis is “duality”.  This means that a transaction that a company engages in has at least two effects – firstly the attainment or future attainment of a resource and secondly the sacrifice of a resource or its future sacrifice (such as a promise to pay in the future) – an exchange of resources that generates profit or is intended to generate profit in the future.  For example, a company or firm only obtains an asset by giving up or exchanging something – the new asset is obtained by giving up a different asset (very frequently, by giving up or paying cash) or by exchanging the new asset for a claim on the company’s resources.  To illustrate, the seller of a piece of equipment will only let the buyer firm have the equipment if the buyer pays money now (a decrease in the buyer’s assets) or later (creating a debt claim on the buyer’s resources) or gives the seller a “piece of the action”  or share in the company and its future profits (creating an equity claim on the buyer’s resources).  This principle is summarized in the accounting equation, which states that"

msgid "However, if company assets only increase by substituting other assets or issuing claims, the business and accounting proves would be a “zero sum game”, and there would be no reason to invest in company equity.  As we know from our personal experience, people can increase their personal assets by working or profitable trading.  For example, suppose that you have credit card debts of $1000, but that you buy a car for $500 and then sell it for $1500 to a buyer who is very keen on that car model.  You have increased your personal assets by $1000 as a result of this transaction, and may use that to pay down your credit card debt if you wish.  Companies can do this too.  However, the duality principle requires that the effects of the profitable transaction be shown not just as an increase in the company’s assets, but also as an increase in the claims on the company.  This is necessary because a company is not a “natural person”, so does not have assets of its “own” - any additional value the company creates must belong to one of the claim-holders.  For a company that has raised funds only through debt and common equity, the debt does not increase if the company makes profits of $1000 on the car deal, so the dual effect of the car transaction is an increase in assets of $1000 and an increase in stockholders equity of $1000\\."

msgid "In dealing with the second problem, the accounting system draws a distinction between users internal to the company and users external to the company.  Internal users of the company’s data (i.e. company managers) are allowed relatively unrestricted access to the company’s data via the company’s management accounting system.  External users of company’s data will be able to access a subset of the company’s data which is produced by the company’s financial accounting system.  That subset of data is called the company’s financial statements (including the notes to the financial statements)."

msgid "In this decision, the stockholder is most interested in the financial performance of the company which is reporting its information.  In accounting this financial performance is measured by the net income generated by the company.  Net income is calculated as sales revenue received from customers minus expenses (costs of doing business).  The calculation of net income is something that we will discuss extensively in the following modules, but we would note here that net income is not the same as net cash received.  This is because the accounting system makes improvements to the measurement of income relative to cash flow.  One example of this is allowing revenues to be “counted” even if the cash has not yet been received, as long as the customer is creditworthy.  The calculation of net income is carried out in the income statement of the company."

msgid "Society has an interest in company financial information being clearly and honestly disclosed.  The availability of unbiased and decision-relevant information about companies helps stockholders decide which companies to invest in and encourage, and which companies to deprioritize (sell).  This in turn leads to efficient and effective allocation of Society’s resources out of unattractive businesses and into attractive businesses – thus helping economic growth in the long run.  Extensive time and effort is put into defining accounting principles and rules that lead to fair and useful information being published by companies (accounting standard setting, principally carried out by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)) and also into ensuring that individual companies abide by those rules (including the auditing process, carried out by independent Certified Public Accountants (CPAs) and regulated (for public companies) by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB)).  This helps to ensure that investors have the information they need and that managers within companies do not overstate their company’s financial health or fraudulently use the company’s resources for their own benefit."

msgid "There are other external users of the financial accounting data as well.  Companies are treated as separate legal persons (from their owners) for the purposes of entering into contracts and taking on loans (borrowing).  Persons or banks considering lending money to a company will be interested in their financial performance as, if the performance is good, this will give some assurance that the company will be able to repay its loans.  Lenders/banks will also be interested to look at the company’s balance sheet to see how much cash and other relatively liquid assets it has (an asset is more liquid the more easily it can be sold or otherwise converted into cash).  Other users of financial information include government agencies such as regulators and tax authorities, employees and unions, and customers and other local and national stakeholders."

msgid "There are two issues that may concern us in processing the large amount of data that a significant business produces.  The first is that the sheer amount of data may limit its usefulness to a decision maker, because he or she will not be able to absorb it all and sort out the data that is relevant to his or her activities and decisions – i.e. “data overload.”  Secondly, when thinking about how much data to make available to people external to the company (especially competitors), concerns of commercial confidentiality may arise if data is made public on matters such as cost structures and contracts with customers and suppliers."

msgid "This module of Haas at Khan Academy concentrates on the financial accounting aspect of the company’s accounting system.    For financial accounting, there is a need to strike a balance between providing too much information and too little.  Providing too much information to the external user would make the information difficult to assimilate and use, as well as exposing sensitive information to competitors to the detriment of the firm.  However, providing too little information could also be damaging.  This is because external decision makers also make decisions based on the accounting data, and they need sufficient data to make those decisions."
