The leading theory is that a huge asteroid or comet slammed into Earth 65 million years ago, blocking sunlight, changing the climate and setting off global wildfires. In recent years, however, researchers have also been investigating whether other forces, including massive volcanic eruptions and changes in sea level, may have contributed to the general environmental decline."

Thus, they argued that an asteroid, about 10 km across, impacted the Earth, generating massive tsunamis, with impact debris cutting off sunlight for months, stopping photosynthesis, and causing freezing temperatures. Chemical reactions in the atmosphere caused acid rain and long-term global warming, all of which extinguished non-avian dinosaurs. Rocks from an impact crater called Chicxulub, buried beneath the shore of the Yucatan Peninsula, were dated radioisotopically at 65 million years, right when the extinctions occurred, confirming an impact."

msgid "**Answer:** Before railroads, paleontologists relied on wagons and pack animals to transports their fossils. These fossils were usually shipped in fragments and with little packaging and information. John Bell Hatcher developed a systematic process for collecting fossils and recording important information about each one, and trains made it much easier to safely ship large amounts of fossils and their surrounding rock."

msgid "**Sample Answer:** Before an expedition begins, we may use satellite photos to identify areas of exposed rock in places where rocks formed during the Mesozoic era. Then we hike across the area looking for fossils. If we find one, we use a brush to remove loose dirt, then use tools like rock hammers to break away the rock around the fossil. We dig a trench around the fossil, pry it out of the ground, and then wrap it with plaster bandages to make a “jacket” that protects the fossil when we ship it back to the museum. Back in the lab, we open the jacket and use smaller tools like dental tools and carbide steel needles to carefully chip away the matrix, as we look through a microscope.  If the bone is damaged, we may use adhesives to repair or stabilize it. Sometimes we’ll make a mold of a fossil out of silicone rubber, then we fill the mold with epoxy resin to make a detailed cast of the fossil."

Welcome, Mr. Brown. How did you discover the first T. rex? How did you feel when you found it? If you could discover any fossil, what would it be?"

In terms of an analogy, think of the Manhattan phone book. It has an alphabetical order and a specific content, including names and addresses. If that phone book were shredded into millions of tiny pieces of varying lengths, as happens to DNA when it deteriorates, how would you go about reassembling the original book?

John Bell Hatcher was one of the first paleontologists to develop a systematic collecting process, which recorded the type, position, and orientation of fossils in the field. With the expansion of railroads in the American West, collectors were no longer as reliant on pack animals or wagons for transporting specimens."

msgid "To find fossils, paleontologists first carry out an operation called prospecting, which involves slowly hiking across ridges and through ravines, while keeping one's eyes focused on the ground in hopes of finding fragments of fossils weathering out on the surface. Commonly, one covers 5-10 miles in a day of prospecting. Once a fossil fragment is found, the collector brushes away the loose dirt on the surface to see if more of the specimen is buried in the ground. If so, quarrying is initiated to collect the fossil. First, awls, rock hammers, chisels, and other tools are used to remove the rock covering the bones to see how much of the skeleton is present. As bone is exposed, special glue is applied to the cracks and fractures to hold the fossil together."

msgid "When fossils arrive from the field, they are encased in plaster jackets, and the rock, or matrix, which was deposited around the fossils. Fossil preparation involves cutting open the plaster jacket and removing this matrix surrounding the fossil. The matrix may be soft and crumbly, when the sand or mud is poorly cemented together, or it can be extremely hard, when the sediments are well cemented. Accordingly, a wide variety of tools is required to remove the matrix and stabilize the fossil. Commonly, dental tools are used to carefully pick away sediment near the bone, along with custom-made needles composed of carbide steel. Formerly, chisels and hammers were used to remove blocks of matrix further away from the bone, but recently, smaller mechanical tools have taken their place. These include small grinding wheels, miniature jackhammers called air scribes, and tiny sand-blasters, all powered by compressed air."

msgid "**Answer:** First, scientists estimate the size of a dinosaur’s brain based on the size of its skull. Sometimes they use CAT Scan technology to reconstruct the dinosaur’s brain. Then they estimate the dinosaur’s intelligence based on the size of its brain relative to its body size. They also consider the size of certain parts of its brain, since different parts of the brain relate to different senses or aspects of intelligence."

msgid "**Answer:** The best evidence for how dinosaurs traveled comes from trackways, or sequences of fossilized footprints. From trackways, scientists can learn whether dinosaurs traveled individually or in packs, how many traveled together, which dinosaur led the herd, and even how fast they traveled. Trackways from multiple dinosaurs can reveal that they were in a herd if the tracks appear to have been made at the same time and are in the same direction. Some tracks show where dinosaurs moved side-by-side, or where the animals’ paths undulated back and forth together."

msgid "The most definitive evidence comes from sequences of fossilized footprints called trackways. Several track sites have now been found that suggest herding behavior in some groups of dinosaurs. At the Davenport Ranch site outside San Antonio, Texas, R. T. Bird of AMNH discovered an amazing set of sauropods tracks in 1940\\. Detailed analyses of these trackways reveal a herd of 23 sauropods rambling over muddy ground at a pace of about 2 meters per second. The pattern of overlapping tracks indicates that the largest adult sauropods led the herd, followed by smaller individuals."

msgid "Trackways of meat-eating theropods are less common, but one occurrence is Bird's specimen from Glen Rose, Texas, a part of which is on display at AMNH. In all, the Paluxy River trackways, some of which were sent to other institutions, reveal the footprints of at least 12 sauropods and at least three, large, carnivorous dinosaurs moving along a mudflat above the waterline. But it is unclear how long after the sauropods passed that the theropods followed or if they moved in a pack. However, in Bolivia, paleontologist Giusseppe Leonardi discovered eight parallel trackways of six adult and two juvenile sauropods moving along the shore in a front, followed shortly afterward by a pack of at least 32 medium sized, carnivorous theropods, moving in the same general direction along the same front."

msgid "These studies, done in conjunction with paleontologists at AMNH, document that that _Tyrannosaurus_, which attained a weight of more than 10,000 pounds as an adult, reached sexual maturity at about 20 years of age and lived for up to 28 years. In order to obtain its immense size and weight, it could put on almost five pounds a day during its phase of maximum growth. As one might expect, these rates of relative growth are fairly similar to those found in birds, which are the closest living relatives of _Tyrannosaurus_. Microscopic studies of these growth rings in _Apatosaurus_ bones suggest that this sauropod's period of fastest growth occurred between about 7 and 13 years of age, when the animal gained about 32 pounds a day - or about 6 tons a year! Although paleontologists used to think that gigantic dinosaurs lived a century or so, based on studies of living reptiles like giant tortoises, growth rings show that their life span was probably a lot shorter, perhaps only 30-40 years."

msgid "Were dinosaurs ectothermic or endothermic? Since birds are a group of living dinosaurs, we know that at least some dinosaurs are endothermic. But the question of whether all dinosaurs were endothermic is more difficult to answer. One approach to investigate this question is to look at the microscopic structure of bone. In many ectothermic animals, bone grows in dense, concentric rings, somewhat like tree rings. In endothermic animals, a complex system of closely spaced cavities, called the Haversian system, permeates the bone. By cutting bones of extinct, non-avian dinosaurs into thin slices and examining them under the microscope, we can look for these characteristics."

In the more comprehensive study of _Anchiornis_, in which 29 samples were analyzed from feathers all over the body of one specimen, revealed that this 155-million-year-old, feathered dinosaur, about the size of a chicken, possessed black-and-white striped wings and a rusty brown crest of feathers along the top and back of its skull."

There are fossils of a couple of turtles from the Cenozoic Era that are thought to preserve the pattern of pigmentation on the shell. Nonetheless, in terms of non-feathered dinosaurs, such as _Apatosaurus_ and duckbills, no evidence for skin color has yet been found."

msgid "Over the last few decades, paleontological artists have often adorned their depictions of extinct, non-avian dinosaurs with a rainbow of picturesque color patterns, in stark contrast to depictions from the earlier part of the 20th Century. In part, this shift reflects the scientific switch from viewing dinosaurs as drab relatives of crocodiles and lizards to viewing dinosaurs as closer relatives of birds. But is there any direct fossil evidence for this change? Well, the answer is no... and yes."

Fossilized feathers, basically modified scales that grow in the skin, have been found on numerous specimens. In 2008, researchers discovered microscopic structures, called melanosomes, within fossilized feathers of an ancient bird. Different kinds of melanosomes create different colors in the feathers."

msgid "Dinosaur fossils have even been discovered in Antarctica and North America, but could they really survive polar conditions? During most of the Mesozoic, the world was quite different than our modern world. The global climate was much warmer, and polar ice caps probably did not exist. Also, the continents were not as widely separated by large oceans as they are today. Nonetheless, studies of ancient geography indicate that some dinosaurs that lived in Alaska, Antarctica, and even Australia lived very near the Earth's poles. Even with the warmer climate, these dinosaurs would have experienced extensive periods of darkness, which would have drastically affected the food supply of herbivorous dinosaurs. Exactly how they adapted to these conditions, perhaps through hibernation or migration, remains a mystery because there is little scientific evidence that can be gathered to test these potential mechanisms."

msgid "The result is a pattern of smaller groups of dinosaurs contained within larger groups of dinosaurs. For example, _T. rex_ is a member of a small group (Tyrannosauridae) that also contains _Albertosaurus_. Both those are members of a larger group, which contains other meat-eating dinosaurs such as _Allosaurus_, _Velociraptor_ and birds, called _Theropoda_. Then, all theropods belong to a larger group that also contains the giant sauropods, called Saurischia. A good way to think about this is to compare it to your evolutionary relationships as a human. Humans, along with apes, belong to a larger group of mammals called hominoids, and hominoids along with monkeys, lemurs and tarsiers all belong to the larger group called primates. By following the sequence of characteristics inherited from more distant common ancestors to more recent ones, one can trace the anatomical evolution of a particular kind of animal."

msgid "To reconstruct the evolutionary relationships between different groups of dinosaurs, one must carefully study and analyze the anatomy, essentially searching for characteristics that are shared among different kinds of dinosaurs, which are then interpreted to have been present in the common ancestor, or first member of a group, and inherited by its descendants. This analysis produces a branching diagram, called a cladogram, on which different kinds of dinosaurs are shown at the endpoints of the branches. The branching points connecting the different branches represent the common ancestor for the group whose branches come out of that branching point, and based on the characteristics shared by dinosaurs on those branches, we can infer that those shared characteristics were present in the common ancestor.

This book was one of the most influential ever published in that it laid out the basic principles of evolution by natural selection. Darwin’s book stated that evolution was the great sum of small changes; in this way it predicted that transitional forms would be found between modern species. _Archaeopteryx_, as was immediately recognized by Thomas Huxley, was just one of these physical links between non-avian dinosaurs and birds. It was a close relative of birds in that it had a wishbone and a reversed first toe on its foot. (This is the toe that allows some birds to perch.) It also had feathers. Some of the feathers were asymmetric, meaning that the front edge of the feather was shorter than the back edge. Such feathers indicate that _Archaeopteryx_ had some capacity for flight."

Included in this diversity from the Mesozoic era are birds like _Hesperornis_—a 4-foot-tall water bird that lived about 70 million years ago in the seaway that bisected North America. _Hesperornis_ could not fly, and it had teeth. Another particularly interesting animal is _Apsaravis_, a small, robin-size flying bird from Mongolia. This little animal was an active flyer that undoubtedly flew above the heads and skittered around the feet of its non-avian dinosaur relatives."

msgid "A key evolutionary innovation of dinosaurs is that they walk with a fully erect posture, holding their hind legs vertically under their hips. The top of the thighbone (or femur) has a knob or head that sticks out to the side of the rest of the bone and fits into the hip socket (or acetabulum) in the pelvis. The hip socket has a hole in the center, as well as a rim of bone along the upper margin, which helps support the weight of the body on the leg. Since these features are present in all known dinosaurs, we deduce that they first evolved in the common ancestor."

"**ANSWER:** Geologists wanted to map the stiffness of the soil throughout the city to understand the damage patterns from the past earthquake. The type of soil affects the seismic vibrations and damage caused by an earthquake. Softer soils amplify the ground shaking, while stiffer soils can muffle it. They also wanted to help guide rebuilding efforts and prepare for the next earthquake. They use sledgehammers to help them measure shear wave velocity, which is related to soil stiffness. They hit the ground with sledgehammers to produce surface waves and then they used sensors to measure the speed of these surface waves—the shear wave velocity."

msgid "An earthquake is the sudden movement of the Earth's crust. Earthquakes occur along fault lines, cracks in the Earth's crust where tectonic plates meet. They occur where plates are subducting, spreading, slipping, or colliding. As the plates grind together, they get stuck and pressure builds up. Finally, the pressure between the plates is so great that they break loose. Depending on how much pressure has built up, the ground may tremble slightly or shake forcefully."

msgid "In 1906, the seismologist Henry Reid developed the “elastic rebound theory” to explain earthquakes. When rocks begin to press against each other, they initially bend, like a spring, to accommodate the opposing forces. Eventually, when the rocks reach a point where they cannot bend further, they break. The bent rocks snap back, or rebound, to their original shape. The break is the fault itself, and the shock waves emanating from the rebound are the earthquake. The shock waves vibrate through the Earth, making it “ring” like a bell."

That means the calculations can be applied to models modified for use in places like the Pacific Northwest, which has a coastal fault line of the same type and length, and with similar bathymetry, as Sumatra. A magnitude 9 earthquake there could produce a tsunami that could affect coasts worldwide. Since local communities would be hit hardest, however, Titov is now working to test dozens of scenarios with his models, trying different combinations of earthquake magnitudes, locations, and local bathymetries in northern California, Oregon, Washington, and British Columbia. If an earthquake occurs at any fault in the Pacific basin, emergency managers could draw from this stockpile of scenarios to predict wave characteristics and time of strike at a particular coastline."

For example, the tsunami took 30 to 32 hours to reach the most distant coastlines, such as those in Halifax, Nova Scotia, 24,000 km from Sumatra. Curiously, some wide-ranging spots like Halifax and Lima, Peru, recorded waves several times larger than those that hit the Cocos Islands in Australia, only 1,000 km from the source. “Now we realize how a tsunami can import energy into different oceans,” says Titov. It turns out that the energy can be channeled by mid-ocean ridges: long, underwater mountain ranges formed by magma rising up in between plate boundaries. “The mid-Atlantic ridge provided the pathway for the tsunami into the Atlantic,” he explains."

msgid "Efforts to detect earthquakes stretch back thousands of years. In 132 CE, Chinese polymath Zhang Heng crafted what is thought to be the first seismic instrument, a bronze vase-shaped device with eight tubes, corresponding to direction points on a compass, protruding from it. When the vase detected an earthquake, the ball would drop from the appropriate tube into a container below, indicating the direction of the quake. Contemporary reports indicate this primitive seismoscope could detect quakes hundreds of miles away, though later attempts to replicate the device couldn’t reproduce this degree of accuracy."

It’s also a logarithmic scale and comparable to Richter for small and medium quakes—a 5.0 on the Richter scale, for example, is also about a 5.0 MW quake—but better-suited to measuring large quakes."

msgid "Initially devised only to compare the strength of moderate quakes along the San Andreas fault in southern California, the Richter scale was eventually generalized to measure earthquakes all over the world. The Richter scale is logarithmic, with each step up the scale marking a tenfold increase in quake strength—a 4.0 quake on the Richter scale is, for instance, releases 10 times the energy of a 3.0 earthquake. The problem was that for large quakes—over 7.0 on the scale—the Richter scale was less reliable."

msgid "Convection is the process by which less dense material rises and more dense material sinks. The former are said to be more “buoyant” than the latter, and the vertical forces due to density difference are referred to as buoyancy forces. Rocks, water, and air—indeed, most materials—expand and thus become less dense as temperature increases, so convection is typically driven by temperature differences. In Earth’s mantle hot rock rises and slightly cooler rock sinks."

msgid "Everyday examples of convection in liquids include lava lamps or water heating on a stove. But the mantle is, in general, solid. It turns out that rocks, along with most other solids, flow by a solid-state, creeping motion, especially when they are hot and given enough time. This is what happens in the mantle. Based on observations of the rates at which the surface of Earth moves, geologists estimate the mantle convectively flows at rates of several centimeters a year."

msgid "Plate tectonics refers to the movement of the rigid plates around the surface of Earth. The outer portion of the planet, or lithosphere, is relatively rigid because it is relatively cold. The lithosphere varies in thickness but is typically a hundred or so kilometers thick. It includes the upper mantle and both the continental and oceanic crust. The mantle’s convective motions break the lithosphere into plates and move them around the surface of the planet. These plates may move away from, move by, or collide with each other. This process forms ocean basins, shifts continents, and pushes up mountains."

msgid "Tectonic plates break apart and diverge where the mantle beneath is upwelling. In such regions mid-ocean ridges develop, and new lithosphere and crust form to replace the material that is moving away. Where plates converge, usually where the mantle is downwelling, one plate is forced beneath another. When this involves plates with embedded continental crust, mountain belts such as the Alps and Himalayas form. If the collision involves plates with oceanic crust, subduction zones form where one plate descends into the mantle beneath the other plate. Above these subduction zone chains of volcanoes and island arcs like the Aleutians, develop."

msgid "The churning of the mantle also affects the chemical composition of the ocean and has a long-term influence on climate. Mantle convection is the main way heat from Earth’s interior is transported to its surface, and this heat escapes principally through mid-ocean ridges. In fact, the connected mid-ocean ridge system is in essence a 80,000 km long volcano. Escaping heat along these ridges causes hot water to circulate through the crust in a “hydrothermal system.” As seawater reacts with the hot rocks, its composition changes. Over the course of several million years, all of the water in the world's oceans cycles through the oceanic crust at mid-ocean ridges. This is how the hydrothermal circulation influences ocean composition."

Heating due to the decay of radioactive isotopes (mainly potassium, thorium, and uranium) contributes 50 to 80%. Thirdly, tidal friction from the Moon’s pull on the Earth contributes perhaps 10%.

Hundreds to thousands of kilometers long, these fault systems are responsible for many of the world’s earthquakes, which occur when a fault ruptures and the accumulated strain is abruptly released. California's San Andreas fault system is an example. So mantle convection not only accounts for ocean basins, continents, and mountains, it is also the ultimate reason for nearly all earthquakes and volcanoes."

As the plate moves, so does the volcano.  The volcano that moved away from the hot spot becomes extinct, and another one forms right above the hot spot.

msgid "**ANSWER:** This image was produced with an infrared camera. These cameras produce thermal imaging of volcanoes, which reveals the temperature distribution of the volcano — where it’s warmer and where it’s cooler. Thermal imaging can reveal where magma is rising beneath a volcano—a sign that it could erupt. It can also reveal the presence of hidden fractures where magma may be moving towards the surface."

"**ANSWER:** This picture shows a volcano forming at a subduction zone. When an oceanic plate collides with a continental plate, it sinks into the mantle below. As the oceanic plate sinks, fluid (shown in purple) is squeezed out of it. The fluid flows up into the mantle rock above and changes its chemistry, causing it to melt. This forms magma (molten rock – shown in orange). The magma rises and collects in chambers within the crust. As magma fills the chamber, pressure grows. If the pressure gets high enough, the magma can break through the crust and spew out in a volcanic eruption."

Like most volcanoes, Etna is located near the collision boundary of two tectonic plates-giant slabs of Earth's crust and uppermost mantle, or lithosphere. As the African Plate sinks beneath the Eurasian Plate, which underlies Etna, it releases extremely hot water, causing partial melting of the Eurasian Plate's upper mantle. This melted rock can exude through fractures to the surface, creating a volcanic eruption. The plate movement also produces lots of earthquakes. More than 75 seismic stations planted at various altitudes on Etna and the eastern coast of Sicily help scientists sense changes in the motion of the plates and reconstruct the movement of magma below. But detecting these vibrations is just one part of the prediction technique."

Before an eruption, the movement of the gases in the magma produces seismic tremors. \"A volcanic tremor is a continuous vibration,\" says INGV seismologist Susanna Falsaperla. \"A kind of breathing of the volcano itself.\" A change in the size of the tremor signal on a seismometer signals that magma is moving—perhaps even rising to the surface."

For example, when rising magma reaches about 15 to 20 kilometers below ground, it releases mainly carbon dioxide and helium. When the magma comes within 3 or 4 kilometers of the surface, it starts to release sulfur dioxide, hydrogen sulfide, and water vapor. As the magma continues to ascend, it sheds chlorine, and then fluorine. Increases in carbon dioxide typically occur six months to one month before eruption, while increases in sulfur dioxide precede eruptions by several weeks to several days. \"And when we observe increases in fluorine from the craters,\" says Giammanco, \"that means the magma is there—it's almost arrived at the surface.\""

msgid "The ratio of one gas to another in these emissions can indicate how soon the volcano may erupt. Various gases require different amounts of pressure to remain dissolved in magma. As magma rises toward the surface, the surrounding pressure drops, so gases with low solubility (such as carbon dioxide and helium) come out first. Sulfur dioxide, hydrogen sulfide, and water vapor follow. At very low pressures, gases such as chlorine and fluorine release."

msgid "It’s all a matter of chemistry. The way a volcano erupts depends on the amount of gas and silica (a molecule of silicon oxygen) in the magma below. Magma with lots of silica is thick and gooey, while magma low in silica is thin and runny. And in magma with lots of gas, bubbles form as it rises. The more bubbles that form, the more explosive the eruption!"

A swirling cloud of hot gas, ash, and rocks, called a pyroclastic flow, rushed down the mountainside at 480 kilometers per hour (300 mph). It burned everything in its path, including the town of Saint-Pierre and nearly all the ships in the harbor. Within two minutes, close to 30,000 people were dead."

msgid "Only about 10 percent of the magma chamber exploded in each “supervolcano” event; still, that amounted to more than a thousand cubic kilometers of material per eruption. “Two of the three eruptions put out enough volcanic ash to spread a cloud all the way to the Mississippi River and the Gulf of Mexico,” says Heasler. This blocked the Sun’s rays and cooled the Earth’s atmosphere, which took years to recover. After each eruption, the roof of the partially emptied magma chamber collapsed, forming an enormous surface depression called a caldera. When the magma chamber filled again to a pressure point, it erupted in a slightly different location. Remnants of the clifflike walls of Yellowstone’s three calderas are still visible."

msgid "Still, a lava flow or a hydrothermal explosion does not herald a new catastrophic eruption. A surer sign would be a dramatic shift in the ground level at Yellowstone, a hint that the magma chamber was moving upward or significantly refilling. Scientists would also look for serious “swarms” of earthquake activity, which would suggest the malleable magma chamber was rupturing the brittle rock above it. Recent monitoring has detected both ground level rises (8 to 10 cm in the past 19 months) and seismic signals, but they’re not dramatic enough to warrant worry. They simply remind geologists that Yellowstone is naturally a place of change."

More importantly, if Yellowstone were preparing to blow another big one, its heavily monitored signs of unrest would also clearly indicate imminent eruption. (They don’t.) More likely hazards are localized lava flows and hydrothermal explosions, which are just symptoms of the park’s volcanic underbelly."

msgid "The first of Yellowstone’s three big eruptions was 2.1 million years ago, the next was 1.3 million years ago, and the last was 640,000 years ago. During each event, gas-laden magma erupted explosively like an uncorked champagne bottle. The explosions shattered magma and overlying rocks into fragments and ash particles. Fluid magma exploded through the fractures and paved the Yellowstone soil."

msgid "[[☃ image 1]]The remaining molten rock in Yellowstone’s collapsed magma chamber is now cooling. It donates heat to the water table above it, which creates Yellowstone’s more than 10,000 hydrothermal features. The hot groundwater can flash as steam in geysers like Old Faithful or belch through cauldron like mud pots. The water also collects in pools, some of which are acidic, near boiling, blue-green with minerals and microbes, and reeking of rotten-eggy hydrogen sulfide. (“The smell of life,” Lowenstern calls it.) An unanticipated hydrothermal explosion could scald or severely injure park visitors and staff."

msgid "[[☃ image 1]]Yellowstone, we feel, is a very, very safe place to visit,” says Hank Heasler, one of two park geologists at Yellowstone. It’s true that acrid, piping-hot groundwater flows just under the park’s rocky plateau, forming a landscape bubbling, steaming, and spraying with hydrothermal activity. It’s also true that three of the most astonishing volcanic eruptions in the geologic recordeach hundreds to thousands of times the volume of 1980’s Saint Helens eruptionoccurred around what is now Yellowstone National Park, which includes parts of Wyoming, Montana, and Idaho. Over three million visitors step onto this charged volcanic landscape every year. Yet the geologists that monitor it are unconcerned about a large, imminent eruption.  Far more unnerving is an encounter with one of the park’s wolves or bears."

msgid "“If a lava flow were to occur here today, it certainly would have an effect,” says Lowenstern. “But it wouldn’t cause many, if any, deaths.” Lava is what magma is called after it breaches Earth’s surface. About 80 lava flows since Yellowstone’s last big eruption 640,000 years ago have filled in much of the three calderas, so that their entire circumferences are only detectable with careful fieldwork. Lava erupting from existing or new cracks at Yellowstone would likely be thick and viscous and have little gas left in it. Thus, it would ooze, not explode, and be unable to flow long distances easily. “Tourists just wouldn’t be allowed in certain areas,” says Lowenstern."

msgid "“To the public, an active volcano is one that’s erupting now,” says United States Geological Survey geologist Jake Lowenstern, who heads the Yellowstone Volcano Observatory. Yellowstone is not erupting, but it is active. About 400 km below it, in the Earth’s upper mantle, lies a **hot spot**: a fixed region of partly molten rock far from any tectonic plate boundary. “You can think of the hot spot as a blowtorch,” explains Lowenstern. “It's creating melt in the mantle, and that melt is rising and melting the continental crust above it.” At the moment, a 50 km wide chamber of molten rock magma sits about 8 km beneath Yellowstone. When the crust above the chamber no longer can withstand the upward pressure of the swelling magma chamber, it fractures and the magma erupts."

Lyell's _Principles of Geology_ was published in three volumes: The first volume was presented to Darwin by the _Beagle_'s captain, Robert FitzRoy, before the ship set sail. The second volume, sent to Darwin while he was at sea, was a diatribe against Lamarck's transmutational ideas. Darwin always saw himself first and foremost as a geologist, and Lyell's work inspired him as he labored to understand the geology of South America. But Lyell's attacks on evolution arguably inspired Darwin in precisely the opposite direction."

"Galápagos tortoises are adapted for different feeding habits. The \"saddle-backed\" tortoises have shells that rise in the front like a saddle. This adaptation makes it easier for them to lift their necks and feed on taller cactus. \"Dome-shaped\" tortoises live on islands where most of the vegetation is close to the ground, making it unnecessary for them to raise their heads to feed.  \n"

In a place where armadillos abounded, he was especially struck by what looked liked the outer shell of an extinct form of armadillo. In another location he found the bones of extinct giant ground sloths. (Armadillos and sloths belong to the Order Edentata, a primitive group of mammals restricted to the South American continent.) Why would fossil remains and modern species found on the same continent resemble each other so closely, he wondered?"

Gould's confirmation that this ostrich was indeed a distinct species fueled Darwin's curiosity. Darwin knew that a larger rhea was common in an adjacent region. Were the two derived from a common ancestor?  \n"

msgid "In the summer of 1836 Darwin wrote up detailed notes on the specimens he had collected. He concluded that the pattern of differences between closely allied forms on different islands, as well as between those on the islands and those on the mainland, had great potential significance. He saw the slightly different forms of mockingbirds and tortoises on the different islands as beginning stages in the development of new species from common ancestors. He wrote: \"If there is the slightest foundation for these remarks the zoology of Archipelagoes will be well worth examining; for such facts (would) undermine the stability of Species.\" In the cautious manner that would remain typical of him until he was finally goaded to publish his evolutionary ideas in 1859, Darwin went back and inserted the word \"would.\" Nevertheless, there's no real doubt that by the time he penned these words, Darwin had become a committed transmutationist."

msgid "Paradoxically, it was commonplace by the 1830s for biologists and paleontologists to talk in what we would now call \"phylogenetic\" terms, terms that reflect the evolutionary development of organisms. Going as far back as Linnaeus in the preceding century, people recognized, whether they were evolutionists or creationists, the existence of \"natural groups,\" and they classified organisms accordingly. They also saw connections between species. For example, Darwin wrote openly to his creationist mentor Henslow about the intermediate characteristics of a snake he had collected: a fer-de-lance with a hard casing at the end of its tail that Darwin saw as intermediate between the plain tail of a European viper and the full-blown rattle of a rattlesnake—which he considered the \"more perfect\" organ.

There Darwin saw the same patterns he had already encountered on the South American continent, though on a smaller, more refined scale. Though he is famous for not having paid attention to the birds that have become known as \"Darwin's finches,\" he did observe that distinct forms of otherwise similar animals occur on the islands. For example, there were three or four distinct \"varieties\" or species of mockingbird on the different islands, all closely \"allied\" not only to one another but also to those on the mainland. His attention was also drawn to differences in the shapes of the shells of giant tortoises, with each island home to a slightly different form."

After several false starts, Darwin hit upon the idea of natural selection, which combined his knowledge of **variation** and inheritance with a realization derived from reading the economist Thomas Malthus: that more organisms are born each generation than can possibly survive and reproduce. The organisms with the heritable variations that make them best suited for surviving are the most likely to produce offspring—and to pass on their \"recipe for success\" to succeeding generations. When environments change, different variants will be favored, and evolutionary change will occur."

msgid "[[☃ image 1]]In those early days of professional science in England, many believed that the idea of \"transmutation\" was false and anti-religious. Transmutation was the contemporary term for what we now call \"evolution,\" or the idea that all species now and formerly alive are descended from a single common ancestor that lived in the remote geological past. The concept was more widely accepted on the continent by scientists such as the well-known biologist Jean-Baptiste Lamarck and by Etienne Geoffroy, who worked at the natural history museum in Paris. In England, the tendency was still to reconcile the findings of natural history—primarily geology, paleontology, botany, and zoology—with a literal reading of the biblical account of creation. Thus, most people in England—scientists, clergy, and the public at large—were creationists. They believed that God had created each species separately, in more or less its present form, no more than 10,000 years ago."

Their appearance correlated with a rise in atmospheric oxygen that some scientists think was essential to this evolutionary step.

The other eukaryotes, true multicellular plants, fungi, and animals, appear later."

On the contrary, the origin of limbed tetrapods from fish, the origin of mammals from mammal-like reptiles, and the origin of birds from terrestrial dinosaurs—all have rich and dense fossil records showing the pathways of evolution from earlier to later forms. Whale evolution, which you will learn about next week, is a stunning example of fossils—and molecules—that converge to tell a detailed story of how an ocean-living mammalian group derived from terrestrial ancestors."

Trilobites share with all these other groups a segmented external skeleton and compound eyes; however, they are so primitive within the Arthropoda that experts disagree whether they are more closely related to Crustacea or Arachnida, which include the trilobite-like horseshoe crabs. And there has indeed been a sequence from simpler forms of life up through the more complex animals and plants, abundantly and consistently confirming Prediction #2, as the fossil record tells us loudly and clearly."

Arthropods and Mollusca are \"protostomes.\" During their embryological development, the first opening, the blastopore, becomes the mouth.

msgid "The oldest multicellular life forms to appear in the fossil record are the \"Vendian\" faunas, which are approximately 650 million years old. Paleontologists have argued over the affinities of these organisms. Some interpret them to be a novel evolutionary \"experiment\" that produced an array of organisms not closely related to today's multicellular plants, fungi, and animals. Others, however, see in these fossils the evidence for \"tissue-grade\" organization, as seen in members of groups such as Cnidaria and Ctenophora (corals, jellyfish, and in the latter case, \"comb-jellies\"), which are primitive forms of animal life still very much with us today. Their bodies consist solely of layers of tissues that perform all their physiological functions, such as digestion; these organisms do not have true organs like stomachs. Some paleontologists interpret fossils such as _Pteridinium_ to be an early member of the Cnidaria. Thus, it seems likely that the more primitive forms of animal life do in fact precede later, more complex forms."

Species were not linked in a single \"family tree.\" They were unconnected, unrelated, and unchanged since the moment of their creation. And Earth itself was thought to be so young—perhaps only 6,000 years old—that there would not have been time for species to change. In any case, people were not part of the natural world; they were above and outside it."

msgid "But what about evolutionary science? How do people see it as being important in their daily lives? Some might propose that it helps us understand the past and where we came from: \"Our place in nature\" is a common phrase. But most people would be hard-pressed to come up with concrete applications that benefit us daily. Why is this the case? The simplest answer is that as scientists and teachers we aren't doing a good enough job of explaining the importance of evolution, which is one reason so many people distrust or misunderstand the importance of teaching it. Understanding some of the many ways that evolutionary science—including tree-thinking, molecular evolution, population genetics, and studies of natural and artificial selection—contributes to our individual and collective well-being is an important first step. Here are some examples."

However, the new tool of _metagenomics_, the study of DNA extracted from environmental samples like soils or water, offers great promise for increasing life's inventory. Metagenomic samples contain the DNA of thousands of organisms, mostly forms of bacteria. Comparing their gene sequences to those of known organisms using phylogenetic analysis often reveals new life forms."

msgid "In the summer of 1999 a small number of elderly residents of Queens, New York, were fatally stricken by an infection that doctors initially diagnosed as St. Louis encephalitis, a mosquito-borne virus. At the same time wild crows began to die in startling numbers, along with captive birds in New York-area zoos. The two events were linked when phylogenetic analysis of the viral sequences revealed a new strain of West Nile virus, a mosquito-borne disease rarely seen outside Africa, the Middle East, and Europe. The virus circulates between birds and mosquitoes but can be transmitted to humans and other mammals. Since 1999 West Nile has spread to every state, killing small numbers of people and causing major bird mortality. Phylogenetic analysis has proved invaluable in understanding the timing and direction of spread of this disease and in providing health officials with knowledge that has lessened its impact."

Each year the United States spends about \\$150 billion addressing the environmental impacts of these species, so quick identification and discovery of the origin of invasives are major priorities. A particularly nasty species, a marine green alga called _Caulerpa taxifolia_, escaped from an Italian aquarium around 1984 and rapidly blanketed much of the coastal Mediterranean. The native strain, found in the Caribbean, the Indo-Pacific, and the Red Sea, grows in small patches and is genetically distinct from the aquarium strain. In 2000 _C. taxifolia_ was discovered in several bays along the southern California coast. Was it the aggressive Mediterranean strain, or the less aggressive native one? Phylogenetic analysis of DNA sequences identified it as the former, catalyzing an immediate effort to eradicate the alga."

Perhaps the very best example is a bacterium called _Thermus aquaticus_ that was discovered in the thermal hot springs of Yellowstone National Park. As its name implies, it lives in near-boiling waters, which is possible because its DNA _polymerase_, an enzyme that helps DNA to replicate, functions at very high temperatures. Scientists went on to develop a process called _polymerase chain reaction_ (PCR) that uses this enzyme to make millions of copies of a DNA strand (a process that requires heating the DNA) so that it can be sequenced easily. This single technology has enabled a revolution in the biomedical and genome sciences, including evolutionary biology, and has saved countless lives through diagnostic tests."

msgid "No other continent has as many poisonous snakes as Australia. Most are neurotoxic, and some cause many deaths each year, a good reason why developing antivenins is a high priority. Unfortunately, we know little about the venoms of many species. But since known venom properties correlate highly with a snake's evolutionary history, phylogenetic analysis can establish a predictive framework that helps identify the best antivenin in the event of a snake bite. For example, the Bardick snake and the chemical properties of its venom are poorly known, but phylogenetic analysis shows it to be closely related to the death adder. It turns out that death adder antivenin, which is easily obtainable, works against the bites of Bardick snakes as well."

Phylogenetic analysis of both the rodent hosts and the viral strains revealed remarkable co-evolutionary patterns all across the Americas. This discovery is being used to identify the hosts of new outbreaks and to predict the geographic areas where new outbreaks might be expected. This research strategy is also being applied to the host-viral systems implicated in hemorrhagic fevers (a group of illnesses caused by distinct families of viruses)."

msgid "Trees are also useful identification tools. Typically, when an organism is discovered, scientists compare its features with those of specimens in collections to identify whether it is already known or establish it as new. For example, because genetic data on viruses, bacteria, and other microbes can be obtained quickly and compared to large sequence databases such as GenBank, DNA sequences are commonly used to identify them. As a consequence, the health sciences, forensics, and bioprospecting industries all rely on _phylogenetic sequence analysis_. Here are several examples of this powerful approach at work."

"Feeding the world's people is one of humanity's greatest challenges, and that task is becoming more difficult as the climate changes, soils are increasingly depleted, and humans continue to stress our ecological support systems. For thousands of years, as humans moved around the world, they met the challenges of changing environments by modifying domesticated crops and animals through interbreeding. Identifying the closest wild relatives of these domesticates is extremely important, for often they live in novel or marginal environments and possess genetic adaptations not found in domesticates. Interbreeding domesticates with close wild relatives interjects genetic architectures that often improve crop yields or protect from disease."

"Phylogenetic trees are predictive tools. They represent the expectation that close relatives share characteristics not found in more distant relatives. If we plot similarities and differences on a tree, we have a hypothesis of how these characters change across evolutionary time. Understanding this change—whether in anatomical, behavioral, or molecular characters—has many applications. For example, studying the change in influenza genes are important for designing vaccines and tracing the spread of disease."

Each year the United States spends about $150 billion addressing the environmental impacts of these species, so quick identification and discovery of the origin of invasives are major priorities. A particularly nasty species, a marine green alga called _Caulerpa taxifolia_, escaped from an Italian aquarium around 1984 and rapidly blanketed much of the coastal Mediterranean. The native strain, found in the Caribbean, the Indo-Pacific, and the Red Sea, grows in small patches and is genetically distinct from the aquarium strain. In 2000 _C. taxifolia_ was discovered in several bays along the southern California coast. Was it the aggressive Mediterranean strain, or the less aggressive native one? Phylogenetic analysis of DNA sequences identified it as the former, catalyzing an immediate effort to eradicate the alga."

Half of the DNA in the nucleus comes from your mother and half from your father. Mitochondrial DNA passes only from a mother to her children. Since only males have a Y chromosome, Y-chromosome DNA passes from father to son. Scientists who study evolution are interested in Y-chromosome DNA and mitochondrial DNA because they come from only one parent — they don’t get “shuffled” like DNA in the nucleus. Since this type of DNA remains unchanged from generation to generation, scientists can use them to look millions of years into the past and reconstruct events in human evolution and human migrations."

msgid "\"People have been using the word 'human' since long before they knew they had extinct relatives or, indeed, any close living relatives. So it's really an arbitrary distinction,\" says the anthropologist. \"But I think most scientists would apply the term human to any member of the genus Homo.\" The earliest fossils that significantly resemble _Homo sapiens_ go back to around 160,000 years ago. Although the new species appears to have behaved much like other hominids of the time, it differed skeletally: It had a tiny face tucked under a very large brain case. (Apes have a big face in front of a very small brain case.) In contrast to its hominid ancestors, some species of which survived for over a million years, over the last 50,000 years this upstart rapidly populated the entire globe."

msgid "Along with the dubious distinction of having eliminated all the competition, the trait that most dramatically sets modern humans apart is their symbolic consciousness. Only humans can re-create the world using symbols and manipulate these symbols to create abstract realms of thought. For the past few years, Tattersall has been wrestling with the question of how this nuanced awareness evolved. \"Neurologists think about neurons, paleontologists think about fossils, archaeologists think about artifacts, and it's very difficult to put it all together when it comes to studying human consciousness,\" the anthropologist points out. \"The main point to remember is that you've got a fish brain, a reptile brain, a primitive mammal brain, and primate and ape brains inside your head. We don't know exactly how each of these ingredients contributes to the functioning of the human brain, nor to what we subjectively experience as consciousness. But we're unique only because of all those layers supporting consciousness from beneath.\""

msgid "Although exciting hominid finds are being made almost every year, much about human history remains controversial. There are currently several conflicting theories about the origin of the hominid family itself, \"and frankly, we don't know what the earliest hominid should look like, so we'd have difficulty recognizing it if and when we find it,\" Tattersall comments. Paleontologists differentiate species by comparing the same skeletal elements across fossils from different places and periods. Since it's very rare to find complete skeletons, accurate comparisons are rare or nonexistent. Nevertheless, by comparing thousands of hominid bone fragments, paleoanthropologists generally agree that there are 15 or more known hominid species and have grouped them into about five genera, one of which is Homo."

msgid "[[☃ image 1]]Drawing the analogy that birds had feathers for millions of years before using them for flight, Tattersall believes that the capacity for symbolic thought had to be released by a cultural stimulus. \"My suggestion, which is not original, is that this stimulus was probably the invention of language—the ultimate symbolic activity,\" he says. It's a difficult theory to investigate, but anthropologists know that languages are spontaneously invented, and Tattersall's guess is that children could have done so in the context of play. While no one knows when humans started speaking, archaeological evidence of symbolic cognition first appears as early as 75,000 ago in the form of an engraved piece of South African ochre, and it is indisputably present by 35,000 years later, in the European Cro Magnons' musical notations and cave paintings."

For example, paleoanthropologists are currently hard at work at Dmanisi, a 1.8-million-year-old site in the Caucasus, the first place outside of Africa where a hominid presence has been documented—and \"not a place where anybody would have imagined looking,\" he notes wryly. Dmanisi was the site of a prosperous town in the Middle Ages that was sacked by Mongols in the 13th century and abandoned. When archaeologists specializing in medieval history came along, they were astonished to find the ancient bones of earlier inhabitants poking out of the walls of the basement pits used to store food."

But this tree of life was made by comparing DNA sequences, with physical features playing a supporting role. All living things have some DNA sequences in common because they evolved from a single ancestral species. Closely related species have more DNA in common than distantly related species do, so they are positioned closer to each other on the tree."

The 479 species listed on this tree represent only a tiny fraction of the more than 1.7 million species scientists have identified. Many millions more species are believed to exist.

msgid "Human and chimp DNA is so similar because the two species are so closely related. Humans, chimps and bonobos descended from a single ancestor species that lived six or seven million years ago. As humans and chimps gradually evolved from a common ancestor, their DNA, passed from generation to generation, changed too. In fact, many of these DNA changes led to differences between human and chimp appearance and behavior."

And even two identical stretches of DNA can work differently—they can be \"turned on\" in different amounts, in different places or at different times."

msgid "In the early universe, there were no galaxies. Today, there are many billions. How did they form? Astronomers use the fundamental laws of physics to deduce the basic story of galaxy formation. Galaxies form out of immense clouds of gas that collapse and rotate. As they evolve, stars form within them. Entire galaxies can collide, changing their appearance. Looking deep into space, we see galaxies at earlier stages in their lives, and learn more about their evolution. They are more numerous, display unusual shapes, and have episodes of energetic outbursts. Galaxies can be seen back to more than 10 billion years ago."

msgid "The Sun and the planets formed together, 4.6 billion years ago, from a cloud of gas and dust called the solar nebula. A shock wave from a nearby supernova explosion (when a high mass star uses up its fuel) probably initiated the collapse of the solar nebula. The Sun formed in the center, and the planets formed in a thin disk orbiting around it. In a similar manner, moons formed orbiting the gas giant planets. Comets (balls of ice and dust) condensed in the outer solar system, and many of them were thrown out to great distances by close gravitational encounters with the giant planets. After the Sun ignited, a strong solar wind cleared the system of gas and dust. The asteroids (small rocky or metallic bodies) represent the rocky debris that remained."

Akin to the asteroids in the belt between Mars and Jupiter, these bodies nevertheless made up another category of objects in the Solar System.

But shortly thereafter, we learned that comets, too, orbit the Sun and are not local atmospheric phenomena, as was long believed. Comets are icy objects on elongated orbits that throw off a long tail of gases as they near the Sun. Are they planets too? How about the chunks of rock and metal that orbit the Sun between Mars and Jupiter in the asteroid belt? When Ceres, the first such object, was detected by Giuseppe Piazzi in 1801, everyone called it a planet. With the discovery of dozens more, however, it became clear that this new community of objects deserved its own classification. Astronomers called these small bodies made of rock and minerals asteroids, and have now cataloged tens of thousands of them."

At first the IAU seemed ready to defend Pluto's planetary standing. On August 16, after many meetings over the course of a year, its seven-member Planet Definition Committee stated that round objects in orbit around the Sun are planets. Roundness (though not necessarily a perfectly spherical shape), reasoned the committee, indicated a balance between the gravitational forces pulling matter inward and the internal pressure pushing outward within a celestial body: a scientifically significant state called hydrostatic equilibrium."

msgid "**Answer:** Yes, whenever you view an object in space, you’re looking back in time — and the farther the object, the further back in time you’re looking. That’s because light takes time to travel from that object to your telescope, and you see the object as it appeared when light left that object. All the stars we see are light-years away, so we see them as they looked years ago. Dr. Tyson chose a star that was 27 light-years away because he predicted that Superman would be about 27 years old, and he left the planet as a baby."

"This simulation shows how, after depleting the hydrogen in its core, an intermediate-mass star contracts and heats up until it sets off the fusion of helium into heavier elements. Helium fusion provides a second stable phase, covering the last 10 percent of the star’s life. The increase in energy production puffs out the star’s atmosphere, resulting in a highly luminous red giant star. When the Sun reaches this stage, it will engulf the orbit of Venus and evaporate Earth’s oceans."

msgid "The Sun’s energy is generated deep within its core by one of the most powerful processes in the universe: nuclear fusion**.** Hydrogen nuclei smash together, forming helium and releasing huge amounts of energy. This is why a star shines. It burns its fuel through nuclear fusion (unlike fire, which burns through oxidation). The balance between the outward push of gas heated by fusion and the inward pull of gravity is called hydrostatic equilibrium."

msgid "The solar wind is a constant flow of hot gas that blasts out from the Sun’s corona at a million miles an hour. Fortunately, Earth’smagnetic field and atmosphere almost always protect us: typically, only a trickle of solar wind gets through, sliding down to the North and South Poles and producing radiant displays of light called auroras. Earth’s magnetic field also protects us from the constant flow of dangerous radiation emitted by the Sun. However, sometimes magnetic explosions on the Sun, called solar flares, create storms in the solar wind. Under rare conditions, they can disrupt radio, cell phones, and GPS, or even cause blackouts on Earth. The Sun, the Sun’s magnetic field, and the solar wind together form a dynamic, interconnected system called the heliosphere, which extends across our Solar System to beyond the Kuiper Belt (a disk of millions of comets that orbit the Sun beyond Neptune)."

msgid "Every star forms in a huge cloud of gas and dust. Over time, gravity causes the cloud to contract, drawing the gas closer and closer together. As more gas accumulates at the center, it becomes denser and pressure increases. This causes it to heat up and begin to glow. Its gravity continues to pull in gas and dust, further increasing its mass, and thus its pressure and temperature. Eventually, the center reaches millions of degrees Celsius—hot enough to fuse hydrogen nuclei and generate intense energy. The heat generated by nuclear fusion causes the gas at the center of the star to expand, exerting an outward pressure. When hydrostatic equilibrium is reached, a star is born. Nuclear fusion powers the star until it eventually runs out of fuel and dies. Most stars form in tightly packed groups called star clusters, from which the majority are eventually ejected."

msgid "Though stars may look like similar points of light from our perspective on Earth, they actually differ from each other in many ways. Stars vary in their mass, size, temperature, color, luminosity, and age. They differ in their distance from Earth, and some orbit one or more other stars. They also change over the course of their lives. A star’s mass determines its temperature and luminosity, and how it will live and die. The more massive a star is, the hotter it burns, the faster it uses up its fuel, and the shorter its life is. The hottest and most massive stars are blue and bright, while the coolest and least massive stars are red and dim."

msgid "We can see stars with the naked eye. But to observe them in detail, we depend on technology on the ground and in space. Ground-based telescopes enable scientists to see visible light, radio waves, and some infrared light. Satellites that orbit Earth, orbit the Sun, or journey through space allow scientists to observe light at all wavelengths, free from the blurring and obscuring effects of Earth’s atmosphere, and also enable them to sample the solar wind. In the lab, scientists conduct experiments to infer atomic and molecular properties of stars, and to investigate how nuclear fusion works. Finally, scientists use theoretical modeling and computer simulations to compute how the properties of stars (such as density, pressure, velocity, or composition) change over time."

msgid "Without stars, we wouldn’t be here at all. At the beginning of the universe, the only elements that existed were hydrogen, some helium, and trace amounts of lithium. All other naturally occurring elements were formed during the life and death of stars. At the end of a star’s life, much of its matter is blown into space, where it provides the gas and dust for building new stars, planets, and everything on them including our bodies. Closer to home, when our Sun was born, its gravitational force held gas and dust in orbit, allowing for Earth’s formation. Now the Sun holds the planets in their orbits, heats the surface of Earth, drives Earth’s dynamic climate, and fuels photosynthesis."

msgid "[[☃ image 1]]A star is a huge glowing ball of hot gas, mainly hydrogen and helium. The temperature is so high in its core that nuclear fusion occurs, producing energy. The outward pressure of gas heated by fusion is balanced by the inward pull of gravity, leaving the star in hydrostatic equilibrium. This balance of forces lasts for most of a star’s life, maintaining its steady temperature. Radiation and convection carry the energy from the core out through a star’s atmosphere. When the energy gets high enough in the atmosphere that the region above it is transparent, it escapes out into space as light of all wave- lengths, as well as stellar wind. Though stars may appear static, they rotate and vary in luminosity. There are hundreds of billions of stars in the Milky Way Galaxy alone. Among them is our Sun, the closest star to Earth."

msgid "Alpher and Herman in effect predicted that the universe today should be awash in a faint but uniform bath of microwave energy coming from every direction — the remnant glow from the Big Bang. But they made no attempt to search for it. As theoretical physicists, not observational astronomers, they perhaps assumed that the technology required for such an observation did not yet exist. Furthermore, radio astronomy was in its infancy in those days, and the handful of radio astronomers who might have known how to use the available technology to search for the microwave background radiation were unaware of the published theoretical prediction. So for several years the debate between the steady state and Big Bang theories continued, in the absence of any strong observational evidence in favor of one over the other."

msgid "As the universe expanded, the total amount of light and matter had to fill a continually increasing volume of space, so the density of each had to decrease. But the expansion of space also stretched out the waves of the light traveling through it. And the longer the wavelength of light, the lower its energy. So the expansion of space caused the energy density of light to decrease even faster than the density of matter. Consequently, most of the energy of the universe was soon in the form of matter instead of radiation, and today we live in a matter-dominated universe."

He realized that it should be observable in the microwave portion of the spectrum.

The modern interpretation is that space itself is expanding, carrying the galaxies along for the ride. In 1931, Georges Lemaître imagined running such an expansion backwards in time. At some remote point in the past, he reasoned, everything in the universe would have been packed together at enormous density. Lemaître suggested that all the matter and energy in the observable universe originated in an explosion of space, now called the Big Bang, which launched the expansion that continues to this day."

When the two scientists tuned their equipment to the microwave portion of the spectrum, they discovered an annoying background static that wouldn’t go away. No matter where they pointed the antenna, or when, the microwave static was the same. They spent months running down every possible cause for the static, including pigeon droppings inside the antenna, but they couldn’t find a source or a solution."

msgid "[[☃ image 1]]The three scientists recognized that the radiant energy of the Big Bang must still exist in the universe today, although greatly reduced in intensity by the expansion of space. Alpher and Herman went on to calculate the present temperature corresponding to this energy. The answer they got was 5 K, which means 5 degrees above absolute zero on the Kelvin scale. (At absolute zero, the lowest possible temperature, molecular motion and thermal radiation come to a complete stop.) Radiant energy at a temperature of 5 K is mostly in the frequency band of microwaves."

msgid "13.8 billion years ago the entire observable universe was smaller than an atom, and almost infinitely hot and dense. This period is what scientists refer to as theBig Bang. Then the universe inflated to an astronomical size in just an instant. Its temperatures and density fell, but were still as hot and dense as the center of a star, so that heavy hydrogen (deuterium) and helium formed everywhere. No new deuterium has since been made, so measuring the amount the universe contains allows us to determine the extraordinary conditions that existed only fifteen minutes after the Big Bang. The universe was still so dense then that it was entirely opaque: the light was trapped with the matter. After some 380,000 years (less than 0.01% of the current age of the universe), as the universe continued to expand and cool, ionized hydrogen and helium combined with electrons to form neutral atoms, and the universe became transparent, allowing light to travel freely. This moment — when the universe became transparent — is captured in the cosmic microwave background (CMB), the primordial radiation that still fills the cosmos and represents the limit of the observable universe."

msgid "Almost all our information about the universe comes from light emitted, absorbed, or reflected by the objects in it. Since light takes time to travel, the farther out into space we look, the further back in time we see. When we flip a switch, the light from the light bulb reaches us in a few nanoseconds (a billionth of a second), but sunlight is 8 minutes old, light from nearby stars has taken years or centuries to reach us, and light from distant galaxies can be billions of years old. Telescopes on Earth, in orbit around Earth and the Sun, and traveling through space, can observe this light at many wavelengths. Space probes extend our reach by sending back data and samples from other parts of the solar system. Since scales of space and time are huge and conditions far too extreme to reproduce in a lab, scientists rely on mathematical modeling and computer simulations to understand our observations."

msgid "Ever since the Big Bang, the universe has been expanding. It contains the same amount of matter but is now a thousand times larger and cooler than it was at the moment recorded in the CMB. Over hundreds of millions of years, gravity acted on the small differences in the distribution of mass present at the time of the CMB. This formed clumps of matter that then collapsed inward to form the first stars and tiny galaxies, and then clusters and filaments of far larger galaxies. These clusters and all they contain are bound together by gravity; they do not expand. At the same time, cosmic space continues to stretch, carrying clusters of galaxies with it. Until 1998 the prevailing theory was that gravity should slow down the expansion of the universe. Instead, scientists discovered that gravity is being overcome by a mysterious pressure. Labeled dark energy, it has been accelerating this expansion for the last five billion years and is expected to continue to do so."

In the last 20 years we’ve discovered that this makes up less than 20% of the total mass of the universe. All the rest of the mass appears to be made of an invisible substance called dark matter. It emits and absorbs no light, but we can observe its gravitational effect on normal matter. Dark matter holds together the collections of stars called galaxies, and determines where galaxies gather together in clusters and filaments. A newer discovery is dark energy, a mysterious pressure that is actually overcoming gravity and causing the expansion of the universe to accelerate."

msgid "Although the idea of dark energy is new, the fact that the Universe is expanding has been understood since the late 1920's. Telescope observations show that galaxies, no matter where they are in space, are becoming more distant all the time. The farther away a galaxy is, the faster it is receding. This relationship is known as Hubble's Law after the astronomer Edwin Hubble, who formulated it in 1929."

msgid "As the two teams analyzed their data, the expansion rate proceeded as expected for the first eight billion years of the Universe's history. It was slowing down over time because of the counteractive effect of gravity. But curiously, five billion years ago, the expansion rate reversed. It started to accelerate and is still doing so. \"A repulsive effect of unknown origin began to take over,\" says Filippenko. Dark energy, they reasoned, was propelling cosmic acceleration."

But it's also possible that gravity might become weaker at very large distances in the Universe, and thus be responsible for the ever-increasing acceleration that scientists observe. In fact, there's a universe of possibilities out there. Astrophysicists would very much like to narrow them down to one."

In 1917, a dozen years before the Universe was found to be expanding, Albert Einstein was working on his theory of gravity. Einstein thought the Universe was neither expanding nor contracting. So, he theorized that a force must exist to balance gravity's constant pull and keep the Universe at a constant size. He called that force the cosmological constant. He even described the cosmological constant's properties: a \"negative pressure\" that could, if gravity weren't pushing back, drive space to expand. But Einstein admitted defeat when Hubble's Law proved his notion of a static Universe wrong. He even called the cosmological constant \"his biggest blunder.\""

These are extremely energetic events so they can be detected at much greater distances than typical galaxies. Stars that become type Ia supernovas all start with about the same mass. Therefore, each explodes with the same amount of energy. Thus, the brightness of type Ia supernovas depends on only one factor: their distance from Earth. The dimmer the supernova, the more distant it is from Earth. It's the same principle that governs how much you squint at the headlights of an oncoming car. The headlights of a distant car appear dimmer than those of a car closer to you. Thus a supernova's brightness provides an estimate of its distance."
