msgid "How do artists engage with memory? Some believe the task of art is to catalogue and preserve images for the future, giving memory a visible form. Then there are artists who create objects meant to convey a personal memory or evoke shared cultural memories. Still others play with images and ideas from the past, reframing them in new ways to encourage us to think about the reliability of historical memory as well as our own. Can we ever trust memory to be objective, or even true? Can art help us explore the fickle nature of what we remember, and how?"

How can sketchbooks bring an artist’s art and practice to life? How can we preserve something as time-based and ephemeral as performance art? How can old archives inspire us to make art in new ways?"

msgid "J.M.W. Turner was both an artist of his time and a radical “modernist,” a practitioner of traditional styles of painting and a precursor of those to come many decades later. He was a robust personality and a sensitive observer of the events that shaped the world in his lifetime. As you learn about Turner and look closely at his work, think about the relationship between biography and practice. Should art be separated from events in the artist’s life or seen objectively? Or do you think a creator’s personality will inevitably influence the work he or she makes?"
