msgid "It’s actually a great question, since at first glance it seems like it would be more efficient to just allow the blood to go out to the body instead of taking a return trip to the heart.  Think of it this way using numbers. Pressure is needed to move blood through the resistance of a large network of blood vessels like arteries, capillaries, and veins. Even if the right ventricle squeezes down and raises the pressure of the blood to about 25mmHg, after passing through the lungs, the blood pressure is back down to about 5mmHg (a reduction of 20mmHg).  It goes into the left ventricle where it gets a second squeeze causing the pressure to rise back up to about 120mmHg (almost 5 times the pulmonary pressure!).  That’s enough pressure to make it through all of the organs in the body."

msgid "Now, let’s say that the right ventricle raised the pressure up to 140mmHg, then you may be able to have the blood pressure drop 20mmHg and still be at 120mmHg.  That sounds like a great solution, except for the fact: 1\\. _If exposed to those high pressures, fluid would get pushed right out of the capillaries and into the lungs (some capillaries would actually break!),_ and 2._At high pressures, blood would move past the alveoli so quickly that O2 molecules wouldn't have time to diffuse into the blood and bind to hemoglobin._ This makes sense when you remember that none of the capillaries in the body are exposed to extremely high pressures (120-140mmHg), because by the time blood gets down to the capillaries it has already passed through arteries (and arterioles), and the pressure has dramatically fallen.  Having lower pressures in the pulmonary circulation is particularly important given the large amount of O2 that needs to diffuse across from the alveoli to the capillaries—every extra millisecond helps!"

This is where hemoglobin, a protein that uses iron to help bind to O2 molecules, comes to the rescue.  Each red blood cell is filled with ~250 million hemoglobin proteins, and each Hemoglobin protein can bind to 4 O2 molecules (the bound form is called “oxyhemoglobin”).  That means that each red blood cell can bind ~1 billion oxygen molecules!  As a result, the vast majority (>97%) of the O2 molecules are actually bound to oxyhemoglobin; with only a minority of O2 molecules floating freely in the blood."

msgid "While air is going in and out of the lungs, the heart is busy working as well.  Blood enters the heart through the superior and inferior vena cava, which are the large veins that bring blood back from the top and bottom of the body respectively. Then, the blood remains in the right atrium, which can be thought of as a waiting room for the right ventricle. The right ventricle (pump #1) has muscular walls that squeeze down and softly push the blood into the arteries, arterioles, and capillaries of the lungs. Next, the oxygen diffuses from an area of high concentration (alveoli) to an area of low concentration (blood), before the blood returns (through pulmonary veins) to the left of the heart. Just like the right atrium, the left atrium can be thought of as a waiting room for the left ventricle.  The left ventricle is a room with even stronger, thicker, and more muscular walls than the right ventricle. As a result, the left ventricle (pump #2) forcefully pushes the blood through the arteries and capillaries of the body to get to the trillions of cells in need of oxygen. For the return trip, blood travels through the veins of the body to get back to the right side of the heart and repeat the process. So there you have it – one heart – two pumps: the right ventricle and the left ventricle."

Meanwhile carbon dioxide molecules make the opposite trip from liquid to gas similar to what happens at the surface of a carbonated beverage. The oxygen diffuses (think of the drop of ink in a pool of water) into the fluid interstitial space of the lung, and is then absorbed into the blood stream, and then enters into the red blood cells themselves.  This diffusion occurs in a fraction of a second because the distance between the alveoli and the red blood cell is so tiny."

msgid "Back in 1928 (right before the great depression), Alexander Fleming first discovered the antibiotic Penicillin when he noticed that bacteria in his lab wouldn’t grow near some fungus, which had accidentally found its way into his experiments. The fungus was making a small molecule which leaked into the petri gel around it, and Fleming called the stuff - “mold juice”. He realized that the mold juice was killing the bacteria in the area! The next big surprise for Mr. Fleming came when he later found out that the fungus was the same bluish-green fungus that grows on old bread. The discovery earned him the Nobel Prize in 1945, and helped humanity develop a key antibiotic which has saved countless lives."

msgid "Developing completely new classes of antibiotics (as opposed to variations on existing antibiotics) is very difficult. It’s easy to find chemicals that kill bacteria, but not so easy to find substances that could be used as medicines, even if researchers were given infinite resources! Researchers are basically shooting in the dark. In fact, the most recent discovery of a novel antibiotic class was in 1987, almost 30 years ago (Silver, L., 2011)! While there are a few new antibiotics currently in development, researchers don’t know if they’ll ever become usable as medicine."

"*   Taking antibiotics responsibly: Take antibiotics only if you have a bacterial infection (not a virus), and pick one that is narrow spectrum so that it doesn’t kill off your healthy bacterial ecosystem. Ask your healthcare professional to help you make these choices. Similarly for animals - narrow spectrum antibiotics should be used to treat bacterial infections, rather than indiscriminate use among healthy animals. Being really selective in how we use antibiotics keeps them from becoming obsolete. \n"
"*   Trash antibiotics responsibly: Disposal of antibiotics should be done in a way that minimizes the exposure of bacteria living in the environment to the antibiotic. For example, you shouldn’t crush antibiotics or flush them down the toilet. That gives the antibiotics direct access to bacteria living in the soil and water. Instead, two options are to either give them back to a pharmacist for disposal or to put them into a sealed plastic bag and toss it into the trash."

msgid "When bacterial cells replicate, there is a small chance the new bacterial cell will not be exactly the same as the original bacterial cell. We call these errors in the copied cell a mutation. In one bacterial cell, the cell wall could be slightly different, in another an enzyme works poorly, and so on. Mutations are key to the idea of evolution, and all of the diversity you can see in nature came from a series of many mutations over hundreds of thousands of years. In animals, it can take centuries or millennia for a species to adopt a mutation which helps it survive (and sometimes these mutations create entirely new species). It takes this long in animals because it takes years for most animals to grow up and reproduce."

"*   **Surveillance**: Some countries have excellent public health systems, and healthcare providers at clinics/hospitals call public health departments about any patient who has an unusual illness or death. Other countries have many rural populations that cannot visit major health facilities because they’re too far away. In these cases community health workers are often sent out, but they sometimes can’t get to every community. As a result, people may get sick and die without the public health team ever learning about it, and the disease can spread far and wide without anyone noticing.\n"
"*   **Contact tracing**: Once a patient is diagnosed with Ebola, the patient is isolated to prevent further chance of spreading the disease. Public health teams then make a list of everyone the patient may have spread the disease to __while the patient had symptoms__ and monitors them for symptoms for 21 days. If one of those people gets sick, the public health team will isolate them and make another list of everyone this new patient may have spread the disease to while this new patient had symptoms. Ideally there should be no one on the list if the public health team works fast enough!"

"1.  The Ebola virus slips inside of a human immune cell (e.g. macrophage).\n"
"2.  The virus turns the cell into a virus factory, assembling a clone army of the Ebola virus. Meanwhile, chemicals that impair the blood’s ability to clot (a condition called thrombocytopenia) are released into the bloodstream. This is what causes the unexplained bleeding in patients.\n"
"3.  The cell eventually explodes releasing Ebola viruses that infect nearby healthy cells. The exploding cell sends out chemical signals which seep into the bloodstream and alert the immune  system about the infection. The immune system’s response to the invading virus is what causes the patient’s flu-like symptoms (e.g. fever)."

msgid "Ebola disease is a life-threatening illness caused by the Ebola virus. In December 2013, a 2-year-old toddler died in a rural village in Guinea, sparking the largest Ebola outbreak the world has ever known (Baize et al., 2014). The outbreak _primarily_ involves three countries in Western Africa: Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone (although there have been additional cases/deaths in other countries). As of early November 2014, there have been over 13,000 cases and almost 5,000 deaths, although experts believe that these numbers could be 250% greater as many patients never seek medical assistance. This outbreak is larger than all previous Ebola outbreaks combined, and the Center for Disease Control (CDC) predicts the disease could spread to other West African countries, infecting over 1 million people by January 2015 (Meltzer et al., 2014)!"

msgid "Why are some countries more affected by Ebola than others? The answer comes down to having an effective public health system. There is a race taking place. On one side, the virus is quickly moving from one person to another. On the other side, the public health team is trying to find and isolate everyone with Ebola so that the virus can’t spread. Speed matters on both sides, and if the public health team can move _quicker than the virus_, then transmission ends. This requires good surveillance and contact tracing."

"*   You may have noticed that men have more red blood cells and hemoglobin in a given volume of blood than women. Why do you think that might be? Scientists are not sure yet, but one hypothesis is that higher testosterone levels in men stimulates red blood cell production.\n"
"*   Some athletes have been found \"blood doping\", by using products like the hormone erythropoietin before a major event.  Why would they do that? One reason is that erythropoietin (normally made in the kidney) is a hormone that helps to boost the production of RBC's. Injecting extra erythropoietin means that more RBC's are made, which means more oxygen is carried to muscles with each heart beat during the event. Blood doping is considered cheating in most sports, and it's dangerous to the athlete because rapidly getting too many RBCs increases the thickness of blood, which can lead to heart failure and stroke!"

"*   __Hemolytic anemias__ are a group of diseases in which the red blood cells are destroyed prematurely. When hemoglobin within red blood cells is broken down, the center rings of the protein (called heme) are converted into bilirubin. We usually get rid of bilirubin through urine/stool, but if there is too much of it floating around, then it can build up in the body and cause the skin to turn yellow (aka. jaundice).\n"
"*   In __iron-defiency anemia__, the body is not able to make hemoglobin effectively since each heme contains a bit of iron within it. Patients lacking iron sometimes get the strange urge to eat things like dirt, sand, or ice as a result. \n"
"*   In pregnant women, the blood gets diluted as blood volume goes up but the number of red blood cells stay the same. This form of \"__dilutional anemia__\" is common, and the increased blood volume can cause heart palpitations (that feeling of your heart skipping a beat).\n"
"*   Patients with __sickle cell anemia__ have red blood cells that are deformed and don't sail smoothly through blood vessels. When these red blood cells clog up blood vessels it can lead to intense pain in the bones or chest."

Globin is a protein, which is like bricks and mortar for a house; it provides structure. The heme is a disk within the globin protein that holds a single atom of iron in its center. In fact, iron is what makes blood the color red when it's around oxygen, just like how iron will rust (also red!) in the presence of oxygen. Each heme can attach to 1 molecule of oxygen and each globin holds exactly 4 hemes."

msgid "- Medications for major depressive disorder are called antidepressants. Antidepressants work by improving the effects of neurotransmitters in the brain. Some focus on blocking the reabsorption of specific neurotransmitters. These include serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) and norepinephrine and dopamine reuptake inhibitors (NDRIs). Other antidepressants, like monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) focus on increasing neurotransmitter levels by regulating the enzyme (called monoamine oxidase) that is usually involved in reabsorbing them into the brain."

msgid "- People around the world experience mood disorders, but some cultures use different terms to describe them. For example, people in Latin America use the word “susto” to describe a mental illness with symptoms similar to depression. Susto occurs when a person goes through a life event that is so traumatic, their soul leaves their body. It can cause problems with sleep and appetite, feelings of sadness and low self-worth, decreased interest in activities, and sometimes results in suicide or death. So, when you think about depression, remember to be mindful of cultural differences and context – it may help you better understand how the illness may progress and be treated within specific populations."

msgid "- Psychotherapy does not address the underlying causes of depression, but it can improve functioning both during and after depressive episodes. One of the most effective psychotherapies for major depressive disorder is cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). CBT focuses on identifying negative thoughts, emotions, beliefs, and behaviors and replacing them with more positive ones. This helps patients cope with old traumas as well as new stressful situations. Other forms of therapy focus on improving social relationships and setting long term goals. Psychotherapy is often combined with medication or other psychiatric treatments. "

msgid "- While depression is a treatable mental illness, many people avoid seeking treatment. Why? In the United States, stigmas about depression and other mental illnesses are often the cause. In our culture, it is common to incorrectly believe that depression is a sign of weakness or a bad attitude - many people don’t think of depression as a real medical issue. As a result, those who experience depression may feel like there is something wrong with them - they feel guilty, hopeless, or ashamed that they can’t “just get over it.” To help change negative assumptions about depression, we should start thinking and talking about depression in the same way that we talk about other medical issues. If a person was diagnosed with cancer, wouldn’t we encourage them to try chemotherapy or radiation therapy? If a person burned their arm, wouldn’t we tell them to go to the hospital? When we approach mental illness from the same perspective, we can help empower people with depression to seek treatment and recover. "

msgid "About 5% of adults around the world and 6.9% of adults in the US deal with depression at some point during their life. You are more likely to experience depression if you are female, have a medical condition like cancer or heart disease, and live in an area with low access to healthcare and employment. The high prevalence of depression has made suicide a significant public health problem in the US, and in 2013 it was the 10th leading cause of death. Rates of suicide are especially high among vulnerable populations like military veterans, individuals who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, or questioning, and young people between the ages of 15 and 24."

One situation, called a chemical imbalance, can produce changes in different aspects of your mental and physical health. Many scientists believe that the severe behavioral and emotional changes found in depression are caused by imbalances in or malfunctions of neurotransmitters called monoamines. Monoamines are found in large concentrations in your body’s limbic system, which controls your emotions, sleep, appetite, and memory. When concentrations of monoamines are too low, symptoms of depression appear."

"Half of your chromosomes come from your mother and half come from your father. Through a process called *meiosis* each of your parents creates a sex cell (either a sperm or an egg) that contains half of their chromosomes. When the sperm cell and the egg cell combine, they create a new fertilized cell (how cute!) that contains 46 chromosomes. That cell then starts making new copies of itself, through a process called *mitosis*, each with 46 chromosomes. (Check out this great [video](/science/biology/cellular-molecular-biology/meiosis/v/comparing-mitosis-and-meiosis) on mitosis and meiosis)\n"

The athlete is usually out of breath if their sport required them to physically exert themselves. Pay attention to whether the athlete needs to take a breath mid-sentence while they is speak. Running out of breath while speaking is typical during physical exertion, but is very unusual while at rest and could be a sign of respiratory distress."

That’s not completely true however, low levels of oxygen in your blood (a condition called hypoxemia) can cause your hands/feet to turn a bluish-purple color - a symptom called cyanosis. Cyanosis can look really different depending on someone’s skin tone. People with light-colored skin can have a bluish hue in the nail beds, palms/soles, lips, and earlobes, whereas people with dark-colored skin might have a grey or ash colour in their nail beds. While you're looking at the nails, also look for clubbing which is when the fingernails spoon over the tips of the fingers and the finger tips start looking like a little club or chicken drumstick."

You’ve sawed off the end of the bottle and covered it with a big rubber sheet. Let’s imagine the soda bottle is your chest wall, the balloon is your lungs and respiratory tract, and the green rubber sheet is your diaphragm. If you pull on the rubber sheet, you create a low pressure inside the bottle by increasing the volume of the bottle. Air from outside the bottle rushes into the balloon to equalizes the pressure. This is how inhalation works! Your diaphragm increases the chest cavity size, and air rushes into your lungs to equalize the pressure by expanding your lungs."

msgid "Paradoxical breathing occurs when part of the chest wall is broken and has become flexible. During inspiration the chest moves upwards reducing the pressure within the thorax, but because the chest wall is no longer sturdy, it gets sucked into the chest cavity. Similarly when the chest falls during expiration, thoracic pressure increases and the malleable chest wall is pushed outwards. Paradoxical breathing is seen in patients with chest trauma, often from motor vehicle accidents."

Although attacks rarely occur more than twice a year, they are often unpredictable, and occur without warning. It is very common to experience motor or sensory symptoms such as tingling, pins and needles, muscle weakness (often in one side of the body), muscle spasms, loss of vision or double-vision, slurred speech, fatigue, dizziness, and bladder and bowel difficulties.

msgid "A combination of genetic and environmental factors are thought to influence whether or not a person will get multiple sclerosis. Among these, the potential link between Vitamin D deficiency and the risk of developing multiple sclerosis is a very active area of interest. The rationale for this is based on observations that the prevalence of multiple sclerosis tends to be higher in countries that are further away from the equator. In addition, the risk for this disease decreases for people who immigrate from countries further from the equator to countries that are closer to the equator. As countries far from the equator have less sunshine, the people living there tend to have lower levels of vitamin D, leading to the hypothesis that the lack of vitamin D may play a role in the development of multiple sclerosis. More direct evidence that vitamin D may be a protective factor has come from a recent study showing that people with early stage multiple sclerosis, with higher blood levels of vitamin D, had fewer new active lesions, a slower increase in brain lesion volume, lower loss of brain volume, and less disability.$^3$ Several randomized controlled trials are now underway to better establish whether or not identifying and correcting vitamin D deficiency should become routine practice for newly diagnosed multiple sclerosis patients."

That said, some are more common than others, especially symptoms associated with the autonomic nervous system - which regulates many bodily functions including heart rate, digestion, breathing, urination, widening of the pupils, and sexual arousal - as well as visual, motor, and sensory dysfunctions.

msgid "The fluid surrounding the brain and within the spinal column is normally separated from the bloodstream by the blood-brain barrier (a highly selective permeable membrane that prevents immune cells and other unwanted material from entering the central nervous system). Although it is not known why, people with multiple sclerosis often have a leakage in the blood-brain barrier, which allows immune cells through enabling them to invade and attack the nerve tissue inside. This autoimmune attack causes inflammation and destruction of the myelin sheaths of the neurons, disrupting the flow of information along the nerve pathways. "

msgid "The reason why the immune system starts its attack on the myelin coating of neurons in the central nervous system is not yet known. However, it is clear that accumulating nerve tissue damage due to this autoimmune response is responsible for disease progression. Although multiple sclerosis is not directly inherited, clustering in families indicates genetics do play a role. There are likely multiple genes involved and some scientists propose that the combination of genetic make-up and specific environmental factors may trigger the autoimmune response. Possible environmental factors suggested so far include where you live - multiple sclerosis tends to be more common in countries further from the equator, vitamin D deficiency, viral infections, and smoking. Other factors that are associated with a higher risk of developing multiple sclerosis include: age and gender - it is most often diagnosed in young people, between the ages of 15 and 40, and affects twice as many women as men. You are also at higher risk for this disease if you have certain other autoimmune diseases including thyroid disease, type 1 diabetes, or inflammatory bowel disease."

msgid "There are three oral disease modifying therapies that treat relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis, fingolimod, teriflunomide, and dimethyl fumarate. They all effectively reduce relapse rates by around 50%, but also cause a variety of side effects. For example, fingolimod can’t be taken by people with a heart condition, teriflunomide causes multiple troublesome side effects at the higher, more effective dosage, and dimethyl fumarate commonly causes gastrointestinal upsets. As a result, the safety profile of the medications strongly influences whether or not they are suitable for a patient to take.  "
