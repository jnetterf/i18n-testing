"Changes in the determinants of supply and/or demand result in a new equilibrium price and quantity. When there is a change in supply or demand, the old price will no longer be an equilibrium. Instead, there will be a shortage or surplus, and price will subsequently adjust until there is a new equilibrium. For example, suppose there is a sudden invasion of aggressive unicorns. There will be more people who want to buy unicorn repellent at all possible prices, causing demand to increase. At the original price, there will be a shortage of unicorn repellant, signalling sellers to increase the price until the quantity supplied and quantity demanded are once again equal. "

"MARKETS: Disequilibrium\n"
"Whenever markets experience imbalances—creating disequilibrium prices, surpluses, and shortages—market forces drive prices toward equilibrium. A surplus exists when the price is above equilibrium, which encourages sellers to lower their prices to eliminate the surplus. A shortage will exist at any price below equilibrium, which leads to the price of the good increasing. For example, imagine the price of dragon repellent is currently $\\$6$ per can. People only want to buy $400$ cans of dragon repellent, but the sellers are willing to sell $600$ cans at that price. Sellers will lower their prices to attract buyers for their unsold cans of dragon repellant. "

"* Not all costs are monetary costs. Opportunity costs are expressed in terms of how much of another good, service, or activity must be given up in order to pursue or produce another activity or good. For example, when you head out to see a movie, the cost of that activity is not just the price of a movie ticket, but the value of the next best alternative, such as cleaning your room.\n"
"* Going from an inefficient amount of production to an efficient amount of production is not economic growth. For example, suppose an economy can make two goods: chocolate donuts and cattle prods. But half of their donut machines aren’t being used, so they aren’t fully using all of their resources. Graphically, that would be represented by a combination of goods in the interior of their PPC. If they then put all of those donut machines to work, they aren’t acquiring more resources (which is what we mean by economic growth). Instead, they are just using their resources more efficiently and moving to a new point on the PPC. \n"
"* On the other hand, if this economy is making as many donuts and cattle prods as it can, and it acquires more donut machines, it has experienced economic growth because it now has more resources (in this case, capital) available. This would be represented in a PPC graph as a shift outward of the entire PPC curve."

"Term | Definition \n"
"- | - | -\n"
"**production possibilities curve (PPC)** | (also called a production possibilities frontier) a graphical model that represents all of the different combinations of two goods that can be produced; the PPC captures scarcity of resources and opportunity costs.\n"
"**opportunity cost** | the value of the next best alternative to any decision you make; for example, if Abby can spend her time either watching videos or studying, the opportunity cost of an hour watching videos is the hour of studying she gives up to do that.\n"
"**efficiency** | the full employment of resources in production; efficient combinations of output will always be on the PPC.\n"
"**inefficient use (under-utlization) of resources** | the underemployment of any of the four economic resources (land, labor, capital and entrepreneurial ability); when using the PPC model inefficient combinations of production are represented as points on the interior of a PPC. If a country is not using all of its labor to produce goods and services, for instance, it isn’t operating at an efficient output level.\n"
"**growth** | an increase in an economy's total production and overall ability to produce goods and services over time; economic growth in graph of the PPC model is illustrated by a shift out of the PPC.\n"
"**contraction** | a decrease in output that occurs due to the under-utilization of resources; in a graphical model of the PPC, a contraction is represented by moving from a point on the PPC to an inefficient interior point.\n"
"**constant opportunity costs** | when the opportunity cost of a good remains constant as output of the good increases, which is represented as a PPC curve that is a straight line; for example, if Colin always gives up producing $2$ fidget spinners every time he produces a Pokemon card, he has constant opportunity costs.\n"
"**increasing opportunity costs** | when the opportunity cost of a good increases as output of the good increases, which is represented in a graph as a PPC that is bowed out from the origin; for example Julissa gives up $2$ fidget spinners when she produces the first Pokemon card, and $4$ fidget spinners for the second Pokemon card, so she has increasing opportunity costs. \n"
"**decreasing opportunity costs** | when the opportunity cost of a good decreases as output of the good increases, which is represented as a PPC that is bowed in toward the origin; for example when Manuel gives up $2$ fidget spinners when he produces the first Pokemon card, but only $1$ for the second card, so he has decreasing opportunity costs.\n"
"**productivity** | (also called technology) the ability to combine economic resources; an increase in productivity can economic growth even if economic resources have not changed, which would be represented by a shift out of the PPC."

"**absolute advantage** | the ability to produce more of a good than another entity, given the same resources. For example, in a single day, Owen can embroider $10$ pillows and Penny can embroider $15$ pillows, so Penny has absolute advantage in embroidering pillows.\n"
"**comparative advantage** | the ability to produce a good at a lower opportunity cost than another entity. For example, for every pillow Owen embroiders his opportunity cost is $2$ scarves knitted, while Penny must forego $3$ scarves for every pillow she embroiders, so Owen has comparative advantage in embroidering pillows.\n"
"**specialization** | when an individual or a country allocates most or all of its resources towards the production of a particular good or service. For example, Sal (an individual) specializes in producing educational videos, and Bangladesh (the country) specializes in producing textiles.\n"
"**trade** | the exchange of goods, services or resources between one economic agent and another\n"
"**international trade** | the exchange of goods, services, or resources between one country and another\n"
"**gains from trade** | the ability of two agents to increase their consumption possibilities by specializing in the good in which they have comparative advantage and trading for a good in which they do not have comparative advantage\n"
"**terms of trade (also called “trading price”)** | the price of one good in terms of the other that two countries agree to trade at; beneficial terms of trade allows a country to import a good at a lower opportunity cost than the cost for them to produce the good domestically, thus the country gains from trade."

"Term | Definition \n"
"- | - | -\n"
"**gross domestic product (GDP)** | the market value of the final production of goods and services within the geographic borders of a country in a given period; for example, if the GDP of India is $\\$2.264$ Trillion in $2016$, this means that this is the value of all new goods and services that were produced inside the border of India, excluding intermediary goods, during $2016$.\n"
"**expenditures approach to GDP** | an approach to calculating GDP that involves adding up all spending on final goods and services in an economy; the expenditures approach categories this spending into five categories: consumption, investment, government spending, exports, and imports: $Y=C+I+G+X-M$.\n"
"**final goods and services** | the goods and services that are actually purchased by consumers, businesses, the government, or other countries; for example, a car purchased by a household, a haircut, or a laptop bought by a household overseas\n"
"**intermediary goods** | goods that are used in the production of a final product; for example, tires are final goods when Katherine buys them at the tire store, but when Acme Motor Company buys tires to build a car that they plan on selling, these tires would be considered intermediary goods.\n"
"**consumption (C)** | when using the expenditures approach, “C” is the category of GDP that is spending by households on final goods and services in a given year but excludes spending on new housing\n"
"**investment (I)** | when using the expenditures approach, “I”  is the category of GDP that is spending by  businesses that is done in order to produce goods and services; investment includes spending on capital goods  (tools, equipment), and inventory\n"
"**government spending (G)** | when using the expenditures approach, “G” is the spending by government entities, whether local governments or national governments on goods and services (such as building roads and national defense); transfer payments are not included in government spending\n"
"**transfer payments** | payments by a government to households that is not in exchange for a good or service; for example, if the government hires a contractor, they are buying a service that is included in GDP, but if they send a retired person a pension check, they are not buying a good or service so it is not counted in GDP\n"
"**exports (X)** | goods that are produced in one country, and then sold in another country; for example, if a producer in the United States makes $\\$400$ worth of Katniss Everdeen bobblehead dolls and sells them to a store in Japan, these dolls would be counted as Exports for the United States.\n"
"**imports (M)** | goods that were produced in a different country than they were purchased in; for example, those bobblehead dolls are purchased by Japanese consumers, so they would get counted initially as consumption (“C”) for Japan, but since they do not reflect something that was produced in Japan, so they are subtracted from Japan’s GDP as an import (“M”).\n"
"**net exports (X-M)** | spending on exports minus spending on imports; when exports are higher than imports there is a trade surplus and when exports are lower than imports there is a trade deficit. “Exports” is the value of goods that go out of a country, “imports” is the value of the goods that come into a country\n"
"**income approach to GDP** | an approach to calculating GDP that involves adding up all of the income earned within the geographic borders of a country in a given year; the income approach adds up wages, rents, interest, and profits.\n"
"**value-added approach to GDP** | an approach to calculating GDP that involved adding up the all of the value added at various stages of production; for example, in the production of a cake that sells for $\\$12$, the value added approach counts the value of the raw ingredients that a farmer sells to the baker ($\\$4$), which a baker than combines with her capital to create a cake, which adds $\\$8$ in value.\n"
"**Circular flow diagram** | a model illustrating the exchange of goods and services between economic agents in one direction and the flow of income in the opposite direction; the circular flow diagram illustrates why the expenditures approach to measuring national income is identical to the income approach"

"* An increase in GDP does not necessarily mean a nation has produced more output; it must be specified whether the GDP in question is nominal or real. An increase in nominal GDP may just mean prices have increased, while an increase in real GDP definitely means output increased\n"
"* The GDP deflator is a price index, which means it tracks the average prices of goods and services produced across all sectors of a nation's economy over time. With this index, changes in the average price level (inflation or deflation) can be calculated between years. However, this is not the most commonly used price index for tracking inflation and deflation; that is the consumer price index (CPI), which you'll learn more about in a later unit."

msgid "Another method of calculating real GDP involves converting nominal GDP to real GDP by using the GDP deflator, which tracks price changes of a nation’s output over time. Canada’s GDP deflator for its base year of 2008 was $100$, since this is the year against which prices are compared. By 2015 the deflator had increased to $113$, indicating that the average prices of Canada’s output had increased by $13\\%$. By expressing 2015’s output in 2015 prices, therefore, Canada’s output would appear to have increased by $13%$ more than it actually did. Canada’s nominal GDP, which has been “inflated” by higher prices, can be “deflated” by dividing the country’s nominal GDP of $\\$2,040$ by the deflator expressed in hundredths, Canada’s real GDP can be approximated using this method.

"However, there is a slight problem with this method. Calculating real GDP by weighting final goods and services by their prices in a base year can lead to an overstatement of real GDP growth since the prices of some goods decrease over time. This overstates growth in real GDP because it makes it seem like goods make up a bigger share of spending than they really do. \n"

"**nominal GDP** | the market value of the final production of goods and services within the geographic borders of a country in a given period using that year’s prices (also called “current prices”); for example in 2017 the value of the United States’ total output of all goods and services equaled $\\$19,495$ billion, which equals quantity of goods and services produced in 2017 times the 2017 prices of those goods and services (source: FRED database)\n"
"**real GDP** | nominal GDP adjusted for changes in the price level; more formally: the value of the final production of goods and services within the geographic borders of a country in a given period using prices from a base year (constant prices); real GDP adjusts the level of output for any price changes that may have occurred over time; for example, the United States’ real GDP for 2017 was $\\$17$ trillion (in 2009 prices); this tells us that between 2009 and 2017 prices in the US increased, resulting in a nominal GDP that is larger than the real GDP; real GDP ignores price increases by measuring output in prices from 2009\n"
"**GDP deflator** | a price index used to adjust nominal GDP to get real GDP; the GDP deflator measures the average prices of all finished goods and services produced within a nation’s borders over time; for example, the United States’ GDP deflator for 2017 was $113$, and for 2009 it was $100$, which tells us that 2009 was the base year and prices of finished goods increased by $13%$ between 2009 and 2017; the GDP deflator $=\\dfrac{\\text{nominal GDP}}{\\text{real GDP}}$ (Source: FRED database)\n"
"**base year** | the year used for comparison in the determination of price changes using the GDP deflator price index; for example, the base year that is currently used to adjust nominal GDP to real GDP in the United States is 2009. The deflator in a base year is always equal to $=100$\n"
"**current prices** | the prices at which goods are sold in a nation in a particular year; current prices are used when calculating nominal GDP\n"
"**constant prices** | the prices from a base year that are used to calculate real GDP in other years; for example, the United States uses prices from 2009 when calculating real GDP in subsequent and previous years; this allows for a more accurate measure of how a country’s actual output changes over time since using constant prices cancels out any changes in the price level between years"

"* You might hear the fourth economic resource referred to as either entrepreneurship or technology. The terms are used interchangeably but mean the same thing: the ability to make things happen. Take the example of computers—a computer itself would be considered a good, but our ability to make computers would be considered technology.\n"

If you see the word capital on its own in an economics context, it refers to *physical capital*—equipment, machinery, or tools used to produce goods and services.

"Scarcity | The fact that there is a limited amount of resources to satisfy unlimited wants\n"
"Economic resources | Things that are inputs to production of goods and services. There are four economic resources: land, labor, capital, and technology. Technology is sometimes referred to as entrepreneurship.\n"
"Land | Natural resources that are used in the production of goods and services. Some examples of *land* are lumber, raw materials, fish, soil, minerals, and energy resources.\n"
"Labor | Work effort used in the production of goods and services. Some examples are number of workers and number of hours worked.\n"
"Capital | Physical goods that are produced and used to produce other goods. Examples of *capital* would be machinery, technology, and tools such as computers; hammers; factories; robots; trucks, and trains used to transport goods; and other equipment employed in the production of a good or service.\n"
"Technology/entrepreneurship |  Two terms that are used interchangeably to describe the ability to combine the other productive resources into goods and services\n"
"Production possibilities curve (PPC) | A model that captures scarcity and opportunity costs of choices when faced with the possibility of producing two goods or services. Sometimes called a production possibilities frontier.\n"
"Opportunity cost | The value of the next best alternative to any decision you make\n"
"Inefficient use of resources | The underutilization of any of the four economic resources, sometimes called underemployment of resources. *Inefficient use of resources* can be represented in a PPC model by a point inside the the production possibilities curve itself."
