"> \"The great city of Persepolis was built in terraces up from the river Pulvar to rise on a larger terrace of over 125,000 square feet, partly cut out of the Mountain Kuh-e Rahmet. To create the level terrace, large depressions were filled with soil and heavy rocks which were then fastened together with metal clips; upon this ground the first palace at Persepolis slowly grew. ….\n"
"\n"
"> Limestone was the main building material used in Persepolis. After natural rock had been leveled and the depressions filled in, tunnels for sewage were dug underground through the rock. A large elevated cistern was carved at the eastern foot of the mountain to catch rainwater for drinking and bathing. ...\n"
"\n"
"> The terraced plan of the site around the palace walls enabled the Persians to easily defend any section of the front. The ancient historian Diodorus Siculus recorded that Persepolis had three walls with ramparts, all with fortified towers, always manned. The first wall was over seven feet tall, the second, fourteen feet, and the third wall, surrounding all four sides, was thirty feet high.  …\n"
"\n"
"> Because of its remote location in the mountains, however, travel to Persepolis was almost impossible during the rainy season of the Persian winter when paths turned to mud and so the city was used mainly in the spring and summer warmer seasons.\"\n"

"> \"According to the Roman geographer Strabo of Amasia, the palace of Pasargadae was built on the site where king Cyrus (r.559-530) defeated the leader of the Medes, Astyages, in 550 BCE (Strabo, Geography, 15.3.8).  ...\n"

"**Note:** In this context, \"paganism\" refers to pre-Christian Roman religious beliefs.\n"
"\n"
">Since the dawn of Roman history paganism’s representatives had received political privileges and exemptions from economic obligations to the state, while in return religion gave a moral support to political institutions. The new career of the Christian church that began with Constantine caused a vast change in this aspect of Roman civilization. The alliance of paganism and the Empire was dissolved; in its place there developed a union of the Christian church and the state. Yet the ancient religious institutions were so intimately associated with the national tradition and custom that the transition from the old order [paganism] to the new [Christianity] was a gradual one.\n"

"Though the Greek city-states were unified to some extent in the face of an external threat, as that threat waned, conflicts between the city-states made a resurgence. Following the [Persian] wars, Athens emerged as the supreme naval power in Greece. It formed the Delian League, ostensibly to create a cohesive Greek network among city-states to ward off further Persian attacks. Under the leadership of Pericles, Athens grew so powerful that the Athenian Empire could effectively dictate the laws, customs, and trade of all her neighbors in Attica and the islands of the Aegean. \n"
"\n"
"The might of the Athenian Empire encouraged an arrogance in the policy makers of the day which grew intolerable to the other city-states. When Athens sent troops to help Sparta put down a Helot rebellion, the Spartans refused the gesture and sent the Athenian force back home in dishonor, thus provoking the war which had long been brewing. Later, when Athens sent their fleet to help defend its ally Cocyra (Corfu) against a Corinthian invasion during the Battle of Sybota in 433 BCE, their action was interpreted by Sparta as aggression instead of assistance, as Corinth was an ally of Sparta."

">The Han dynasty was contemporaneous [existed at the same time] with the Roman Empire and has often been compared to it. Han and Rome both had strong governments that expanded geographically, promoted assimilation, and brought centuries of stability to the central regions. Both managed to deal with enormous problems of scale, ruling roughly similar numbers of people over roughly similar expanses of land. Both developed bureaucratic institutions, staffing them with educated landowners. Both invested in the construction of roads, defensive walls, and waterworks. Both were threatened by barbarians at their frontiers and often used barbarian tribal units as military auxiliaries. \n"
"\n"
"The contrasts between the Han and Roman empires are equally instructive. China was a civilization based much more profoundly on crop agriculture. Not only did animal husbandry play less of a role in agriculture, but cities and commerce played a lesser role in the overall economy. Cultural cohesion was also of a different order in Han China than in Rome. Perhaps because of the Chinese script, it is much easier to talk about a common culture among the elite in Han China than in the Roman Empire. \n"

"Before answering the question below, revisit this passage from the article:\n"
"\n"
"> \"After gaining power, Chandragupta II expanded the Gupta Empire through conquest and political marriages until the end of his reign in 413 CE. By 395 CE, his control over India extended coast-to-coast. Just like Ashoka, Chandragupta II made Pataliputra the capital of his empire and centralized the government there. He used tribute money from allies to fund government projects and salaries. Unlike Ashoka, Chandragupta did not rely on a network of spies or closely monitor the affairs of foreigners or allies. Instead, he let regions make their own decisions about administration and local governance. \n"
"\n"
"> Some scholars have argued that the Gupta empire was a “golden age” of India. The empire was marked by peace and public safety, and scholars flourished in this environment. Kalidasa, a poet of the time, is considered the greatest poet and dramatist of the Sanskrit language; Aryabhata was the first of the Indian mathematician-astronomers who worked on the approximation for Pi; and Vishnu Sharma is thought to be the author of the Panchatantra fables, one of the most widely-translated non-religious books in history.\"\n"

"> \"This separation of people by class and job gained an even bigger foothold within Hinduism: according to Hindu myth, the god Purusha was assembled from the four castes, with the Brahmins at the head and the Shudras at the feet. It was believed that shudras had been born into their caste because they committed bad deeds in a previous life, or **incarnation**. The Hindu ideal of **karma** suggested that people who behaved well could be born into a higher caste.\"\n"

"A number of important changes were taking place in Khotan [a kingdom along the Silk Road trade routes] in the first century [CE]. Among these, we know that between 30-150 [CE] the kings of Khotan issued their own coins. These were the bilingual [in two languages]...with an inscription on one side in the Kharaththi [a central Asian/northern Indian] script, and a Chinese inscription on the other side… The kings of Khotan intended that these coins should closely reflect the coins of the early Kushan rulers of Bactria and northwest India… The bilingual elements and the comparative weights suggests that the … coins were designed to fit both systems.  \n"

">It is clear, however, that Roman women in general had much greater independence than women in most parts of the classical Greek or Near Eastern worlds, limited as it must seem in modern terms. The contrast is particularly striking with classical Athens, where women of wealthy families were supposed to live secluded lives, out of the public eye, largely segregated from men and male social life (the poor, needless to say, did not have the cash or the space to enforce any such divisions). There were, to be sure, uncomfortable restrictions on women in Rome, too: the emperor Augustus, for example, relegated them to the back rows of the theatres and gladiatorial arenas; the suites for women in  public baths were usually markedly more cramped than those for men; and in practice male activities probably dominated the swankier areas of a Roman house. But women were not meant to be publicly invisible, and domestic life does not seem to have been formally divided into male and female spaces, with gendered no-go areas. \n"

"Britain's blockade of Germany in the North Sea had a large impact on the Central powers ability to import goods, especially food.  Germany had a weaker surface fleet than the British and it was being confined to a corner of the North Sea off their coast.  The only way that they could attempt to retaliate with a blockade of the British Isles was through unrestricted submarine warfare.  The main risk, however, was that this would provoke the United States into entering the War on the side of the Allies.\n"

"In the Zimmermann Telegram (January, 1917), Germany outlined to Mexico how it would be likely that the U.S. would enter the War on the side of the Entente as soon as Germany resumed unrestricted submarine warfare (which it planned on doing the next month).  They go on to offer, given the above assumptions, support for the Mexicans to declare war on the United States in the event of American entry into the War.  This telegram was intercepted by British Intelligence and shared with the Americans.  This telegram and Germany's attempt to stir up Mexico against the United States was directly cited in President Wilson's war message to Congress on April 2, 1917."

The combination of hyperinflation, continued resentment over the Treaty of Versailles and the French occupation of the Ruhr made more and more Germans favor nationalist parties (even extreme ones like the Nazis).  This, aided by Hitler's oratory skills, allowed the Nazis to grow from a few thousand members at the end of 1923 to several tens of thousands by the time of the putsch (although it is worth keeping in mind that, even at this point, the Nazis are still a relatively small party).  \n"

"Stalin was *not* a typical Fascist leader. Joseph Stalin was a totalitarian dictator of the U.S.S.R. which is a characteristic of fascism, but he was also communist (one could argue that he was the face of communism for much of the early 20th century).  Fascists tend to be fiercely anti-communist.  \n"
"\n"
"The term \"fascist\" was *not*  first coined as a derogatory term to describe overbearing governments. Even though calling someone a \"fascist\" today would be considered derogatory, the term was first coined and embraced by Mussolini and his followers to describe themselves (the Fascist Party).\n"

"These are the only two statements that are NOT true. "

"There are three correct answers:\n"
"\n"
"Mussolini's rapid rise to power from 1919 to 1922 was based on his bold charisma, a rising discontent with a perceived weak leftist-government, and violent intimidation from the \"blackshirts\".\n"
"\n"
"The Fascists became a national party in 1921 (which was also when Mussolini was first democratically elected to the Chamber of Deputies).\n"
"\n"
"Mussolini's \"March on Rome\" in 1922 with over 200,000 followers caused King Victor Emmanuel III to appoint him Prime Minister (an office he held from 1922 to 1943).\n"
"\n"
"The two incorrect answers:\n"
"\n"
"Mussolini's rise predates Hitler's and, in fact, inspired Hitler to attempt his failed \"Beer Hall Putsch\" in 1923.  So It was NOT inspired by Adolf Hitler's rise to power in Germany.\n"
"\n"
"Mussolini never caused the King to abdicate. "

"The Schlieffen Plan was Germany's way of dealing with a two front war against the French and the Russians.  Russia had a huge army which would take time to mobilize.  Under this plan, the Germans would use that time to execute a quick and massive invasion to knock out the French (on the Western Front) so that they could then focus on the Russians (on the Eastern Front)."

"Russia was not looking to capture territory. The Treaty of Brest-Litovsk in March 1918 actually gave huge chunks of the Russian Empire over to the Central Powers.\n"
"\n"
"In late 1918, the Bolsheviks had taken control in Russia and were eager to extricate themselves from the War and quickly signed an armistice with the Central Powers.  This allowed Germany to begin redeploying troops to the Western Front (which had been a defensive stalemate for much of the War).  If they could go on the offensive before significant reinforcement from the United States arrived, they had a chance of victory.  On the other hand, it could go the other way if the American troops arrived in time."

"The direct cause of the War is generally considered to be the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand, which led to Austria declaring war on Serbia.  This caused Russia to mobilize in Serbia's defense, which gave Germany the pretext for declaring war on Russia and France. Germany's invasion of Belgium on its way to France gave Britain the justification to declare war on Germany.    The domino of events was made possible by the various alliances (most of which were created in the late 1800s) among the powers and the significant arms buildup leading up to 1914."

"Before answering the question below, read the following passage:\n"
"\n"
"> \"The ‘grand design’ view of Justinian’s reign sees all his actions as the deliberate restoration of the ancient Roman empire, though a Roman empire raised to new heights of glory as a Christian empire confessing the orthodox faith. According to this view, reconquest restored something like the traditional geographical area of the empire; law reform encapsulated the vision of a Christian Roman empire, governed by God’s vicegerent, the emperor; the capital’s splendid buildings, not least the churches, celebrated the Christian court of New Rome, with the defensive buildings described by Procopius in the later books of his Buildings serving to preserve in perpetuity the newly reconquered Roman world.\"\n"
"\n"
"From Andrew Louth, “Justinian and His Legacy,” in *The Cambridge History of the Byzantine Empire*, edited by Jonathan Shepard, 99-129. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2010.\n"

"**What does Louth suggest about the relationship between state and religion in the Byzantine empire according to the 'grand design' view?**\n"

Srivijaya’s “tribute” consisted of pepper, resins, rattans, ivory, plumes, birds’ nests, turtles, sea cucumber, and mother-of-pearl; “gifts” from China’s emperors to Srivijaya were industrial dyes, iron, ceramics, and silk. In the Chinese presentation, for seven hundred years a Sumatran state is recognized as a vassal, which acts as intermediary for many barbarian archipelago harbor states, bringing their tribute to China along with Srivijaya’s own. In Chinese presentation, the honor of being a vassal is conferred by China, and it is taken away by China when the vassal proves itself unworthy. In 1380, Srivijaya was stripped of its special relationship to China and the honor of being China’s vassal was transferred to the Javanese kingdom of Majapahit.\"\n"

"Before answering the question, read the following excerpt.\n"
"\n"
"> \"By comparison [to twelfth and thirteenth-century northern Italy], economic life in the Eastern world - in the Abbasid Caliphate or [Song] China - was far more advanced (...). To discover modern finance, Europe had to import it. In this, a crucial role was played by a young mathematician called Leonardo of Pisa, or Fibonacci. \n"
"\n"
"> The son of a Pisan customs official based in what is now Bejaia in Algeria, the young Fibonacci had immersed himself in what he called the ‘Indian method’ of mathematics, a combination of Indian and Arab insights. His introduction of these ideas was to revolutionize the way Europeans counted. Nowadays he is best remembered for the Fibonacci sequence of numbers … But the Fibonacci sequence as only one of many Eastern mathematical ideas introduced to Europe in his path-breaking book Liber Abaci, ‘The Book of Calculation’, which he published in 1202. In it, readers could find fractions explained, as well as the concept of present value...Most important of all was Fibonacci’s introduction of Hindu-Arabic numerals. He not only gave Europe the decimal system, which makes all kinds of calculation far easier than with Roman numerals; he also showed how it could be applied to commercial bookkeeping, to currency conversions and, crucially, to the calculation of interest.\" \n"

"> \"By comparison [to twelfth and thirteenth-century northern Italy], economic life in the Eastern world - in the Abbasid Caliphate or [Song] China - was far more advanced (...). To discover modern finance, Europe had to import it. In this, a crucial role was played by a young mathematician called Leonardo of Pisa, or Fibonacci. \n"

"> The son of a Pisan customs official based in what is now Bejaia in Algeria, the young Fibonacci had immersed himself in what he called the ‘Indian method’ of mathematics, a combination of Indian and Arab insights. His introduction of these ideas was to revolutionize the way Europeans counted. Nowadays he is best remembered for the Fibonacci sequence of numbers … But the Fibonacci sequence as only one of many Eastern mathematical ideas introduced to Europe in his path-breaking book Liber Abaci, ‘The Book of Calculation’, which he published in 1202. In it, readers could find fractions explained, as well as the concept of present value...Most important of all was Fibonacci’s introduction of Hindu-Arabic numerals. He not only gave Europe the decimal system, which makes all kinds of calculation far easier than with Roman numerals; he also showed how it could be applied to commercial bookkeeping, to currency conversions and, crucially, to the calculation of interest.\" \n"

"\n"
"> \"The strategic link in the trade between India and China was the Strait of Malacca, connecting the Bay of Bengal with the South China Sea. Like the Malabar coast, the strait was a hinge [an essential point] in the monsoonal [seasonal wind] sailing system. Vessels crossing the Bay of Bengal eastbound on the summer monsoon could not normally reach China before the opposing northeast wind set in. Therefore they would winter in a port along the strait before continuing around the Malay Peninsula and across the South China Sea in April or May. Climatic reality encouraged India-based merchants to sell their goods in the strait towns, then return directly to Malabar on the winter wind.

There are today Arabic manuscripts from the 1500s copied in Timbuktu on paper that originated in the mills of northern France, Germany, or Italy—according to their watermarks. At the heart of Timbuktu's economy until the late 1500s, was the gold trade. From th[e gold trade], Timbuktu gained its fabled reputation in North Africa and Europe. The boom period began in the 1300s, when merchants from Djenné opened a route southward to the periphery of the forest zone, to what is now the Republic of Ghana. The gold, largely in the form of gold dust, was brought to Djenné overland, traded to Timbuktu by river, and there traded to Saharan and North African merchants, in exchange for rock salt but also all manner of other goods in trans-Saharan commerce.\"\n"

">The Tartars [Mongols of the Golden Horde] set on [attacked] a Genoese trading station in the city of Tana and chased the merchants to their redoubt [fort] at Caffa… a town on the Crimean coast which the Genoese had built and fortified as a base from which to trade with the [East]...Their plans were disastrously disturbed by the plague which was soon taking heavy toll of the besiegers…[F]ew places are so vulnerable to disease as a besieged city and it was not long before the plague was as active within the city as without… [The Genoese] took to their galleys and fled from the Black Sea towards the Mediterranean. With them travelled the plague. \n"
" \n"
"One of the main trade routes by which the spices and silks from the East reached the European market was by way of Baghdad and then along the Tigris [River] and through Armenia to the entrepot [trading] stations of the Italian merchants in the Crimea. Nothing is more likely than that the plague should travel with the great caravans and spread itself among the [Mongols] of the Crimea. \n"

"Before answering the question below, read the following passage:\n"
"\n"
"> \"It did not take long, however, for Scandinavian merchant adventurers to become aware of a particular important fact of east European geography. While some of the rivers of European Russia flow north into the Baltic, others drain south into the Black and Caspian Seas. The whole area is so flat, moreover, that the headwaters of both north- and south-flowing rivers lie extraordinarily close together. A combination of tributaries, especially the west-east flowing River Oka, combined with carefully reconnoitered [observed, studied] portages, where ships were dragged usually on rollers from one set of connected river systems to another, allowed access to the Black and Caspian Seas via two major routes, the Dnieper [River] and the Volga [River]. \n"
"\n"
"> The Volga route led straight to the Caspian Sea and the economically developed world of the Islamic Caliphs, by this date based on the Abbasid capital of Baghdad. There the taxes of a vast empire, stretching from the Atlantic to India, were being consumed by a court of stupendous magnificence. Here was the real center of demand for merchants with luxury goods to sell.... The Dnieper route, by contrast, was far more difficult, involving some awkward rapids around which boats had to be carried, and led out to the Black Sea...and the more natural trade axis led to Constantinople... Byzantium was a sadly reduced power from its glory days under Justinian, and the Islamic Caliphs and their court grandees represented a far richer market for the luxury goods that the Scandinavians had to offer.\" \n"

"Before answering the question below, read this passage carefully:\n"
"\n"
"> \"Those who were not slaves were not all free, for our period sees the development of a status of unfreedom which is not equal to slavery: it is serfdom. There were many routes to such servility: loss of an individual’s land through poverty and debt, or through conquest followed by loss of land. The serf householder was attached to the land he and his family cultivated, and their tenure entailed important obligations which were the mark of servility. Serfs shared the produce of their labour with their lords, they were obliged to execute work at the lord’s request, and they were limited in their right to travel. Serfs were often required to bring their corn for grinding in the lord’s mill and their grapes to the lord’s winepress, and to pay for a licence when they sought to marry outside the manor; a fine beast was paid to secure the passage of the serf’s tenure to its heir. Their lives were hard, and often characterized by writers in our periods as being simple and rude. When bishop Rather of Verona around 930 wrote with guidance to Christians of all conditions, he advised the labourer: ‘be not only fair, but hard-working, content with your lot, cheating no one, offending no one’.\"\n"

Snub-nosed and rough in belted tunic and long hose, he can be seen in carved stone medallions and illuminated pages representing the twelve months, sowing from a canvas seed bag around his neck, scything hay bare-legged in summer's heat in loose blouse and straw hat, trampling grapes in a wooden vat, shearing sheep held between his knees, herding swine in the forest, tramping through the snow in hood and sheepskin mantle with a load of firewood on his back, warming himself before a fire in a low hut in February. Alongside him in the fields the peasant woman binds sheaves wearing a skirt caught up at the belt to free her legs and a cloth head-covering instead of a hat.\n"
"\n"
"> (…) Originally he owed, in addition to agriculture, every kind of labor service needed on an estate—repair of roads, bridges, and moats, supply of firewood, care of stables and kennels, blacksmithing, laundering, spinning, weaving, and other crafts for the castle. By the 14th century much of this was done by hired hands and the castle's needs were supplied by purchase from towns and peddlers, leaving a large part of the peasantry on a rent-paying basis with a certain number of days' work owed on the lord's fields.\"\n"

I have also given him permissions to enlarge that fief with whatever he and his heirs can acquire there; that additional property will be counted as an augmentation of fief (in augmento feodi).

"Before answering the question, read the following excerpt.\n"
"\n"
"The Nahuatl word _tlamatini_ (...) meant something akin to “thinker-teacher” (...) [A _tlamatini_] was expected to write and maintain the codices and live in a way that set a moral example. (...) In what may have been the first large-scale compulsory education program in history, every male citizen of the **Triple Alliance**, no matter what his social class, had to attend one sort of school or another until the age of sixteen. Many _tlamitinime_ (the plural form of the word) taught at elite academies that trained the next generation of priests, teachers, and high administrators. \n"
"\n"
"From: Charles Mann, _1491: New Revelations of the Americas before Columbus_ (New York: Vintage Books, 2005), 134-135.\n"

"\n"
">A momentous decision taken consciously around A.D. [CE] 1600...was the killing of every pig on the island, to be replaced as protein by an increase in consumption of fish, shellfish, and turtles. According to Tikopians' accounts, their ancestors had made that decision because pigs raided and rooted up gardens, competed with humans for food, were an inefficient means to feed humans (it takes about 10 pounds of vegetables edible to humans to produce just one pound of pork), and had become a luxury food for the chiefs. \n"

"Read the following passage and answer the question:\n"
"\n"
">The Bantu did not overrun all the Khoisan, who did survive in the southern African areas unsuitable for Bantu agriculture. The southernmost Bantu people, the Xhosa, stopped at the Fish River on South Africa’s south coast, 500 miles east of Cape [of Good Hope]. It’s not that the Cape of Good Hope itself is too dry for agriculture: it is, after all, the breadbasket of modern South Africa. Instead, the Cape has a Mediterranean climate of winter rains, in which the Bantu summer-rain crops do not grow. \n"

"From Jared Diamond, _Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies_ (New York: W.W. Norton and Company, 1999), 196-197. \n"

"**What is Diamond’s argument for why Bantu speakers did not settle beyond the Fish River?** \n"

">Whatever the reason, it is clear that the empires of Byzantium and Persia failed to keep in check the steppe peoples within and beyond their borders in the late sixth and early seventh centuries. The Turks, Avars, and Arabs are all able to make significant encroachments over the course of this period. The same can be said for China where the Wei dynasty collapsed in 534 and decades of infighting ensued, which was reduced somewhat by the Sui dynasty (589–618) but only properly brought under control with the establishment of the Tang dynasty by Emperor Gaozu (618–26).

The capitals of the Byzantine and Chinese empires, on the other hand, were far from the steppe and extremely well defended, and the empires themselves, organized around large bodies of water (the Mediterranean Sea and the Yellow and Yangtze Rivers, respectively), were reasonably well integrated. This meant that though they also suffered many defeats at the hands of steppe raiders, they were able to weather the storm. The Avars and Turks clearly had ambitions to penetrate further into the lands of Byzantium and Persia, but they were coming from the difficult northern and eastern sides of the two empires, where they faced substantial man-made and natural obstacles, whereas the Arabs were directly adjacent to the soft southern underbellies of these empires, and so it was they who ultimately triumphed in this seventh-century great game.\n"

"\n"
"> \"In Song times, under the influence of both Buddhism and Daoism, Confucian thinkers began to reorganize ancient Chinese thought and create the basis of a philosophical system known as the Learning of the Way. Far more than a single philosophical school, this movement -- often labeled neo-Confucianism in the West -- aimed primarily to establish a social and political order. It defined and reasserted a system of Chinese values . . . which served as the pivot for Song culture in both the public and private spheres.\n"
"\n"
"> The thinkers responsible for this “renaissance” attempted to reestablish the superiority of Confucian philosophy over its Buddhist and Daoist rivals by first clearing out the errors that had infiltrated Confucian learning over the centuries. But during this practical process of rejuvenation, they incorporated aspects of Buddhist and Daoist doctrine and practice that humanized the Confucian program. Throughout the Song dynasty, Confucianism, Daoism, and Buddhism were known as the “three doctrines,” and each played a role at every level of society.\"\n"

Although earlier Muslim and Western writers assumed that the region was forcibly, quickly, and massively converted to Islam, nowhere in the sources is there mention of the conversion of large numbers of people, or of whole villages, towns, and regions. The only known exception may be on the Byzantine frontier. The available evidence points, rather, to a slow and uneven process of social and religious transformations. Moreover, the “modern” notion of conversion does not correspond to the historical process by which individuals came to identify themselves as Muslim for a variety of political, economic, and social reasons.

"> There are a number of reasons for the slow pace of conversions. The Arab-Muslim elite assumed that they would form a dual society in which the conquerors would constitute an aristocracy and the conquered peoples a subject population: the former Muslim, the latter not. Arab elites were resistant to the conversion of masses of people partly to defend their exclusive privileges and partly to preserve the full revenue base of the regime. The early Muslim regime was also religiously tolerant of the non-Muslim populations. In the highly fluid social world of the seventh century, peoples of all ethnicities and religions blended into public life. Muslims and non-Muslims were not segregated in public spaces such as markets, baths, and festivals. In Syria, they even shared churches before the conquerors were ready to build mosques for themselves. The Muslims recognized or accepted these churches as holy places and may not have fully distinguished Islam from Christianity.\"\n"

"Before answering the question below, read the following passage:\n"
"\n"
"> \"Conversion was a very gradual process. Although earlier Muslim and Western writers assumed that the region was forcibly, quickly, and massively converted to Islam, nowhere in the sources is there mention of the conversion of large numbers of people, or of whole villages, towns, and regions. The only known exception may be on the Byzantine frontier. The available evidence points, rather, to a slow and uneven process of social and religious transformations. Moreover, the “modern” notion of conversion does not correspond to the historical process by which individuals came to identify themselves as Muslim for a variety of political, economic, and social reasons. Conversion did not necessarily imply a profound inner spiritual change.\n"
"\n"
"> There are a number of reasons for the slow pace of conversions. The Arab-Muslim elite assumed that they would form a dual society in which the conquerors would constitute an aristocracy and the conquered peoples a subject population: the former Muslim, the latter not. Arab elites were resistant to the conversion of masses of people partly to defend their exclusive privileges and partly to preserve the full revenue base of the regime. The early Muslim regime was also religiously tolerant of the non-Muslim populations. In the highly fluid social world of the seventh century, peoples of all ethnicities and religions blended into public life. Muslims and non-Muslims were not segregated in public spaces such as markets, baths, and festivals. In Syria, they even shared churches before the conquerors were ready to build mosques for themselves. The Muslims recognized or accepted these churches as holy places and may not have fully distinguished Islam from Christianity.\"\n"

"Before answering the question below, read the following passage:\n"
"\n"
"> \"Travel and trade also flourished in this period [...] One 9th-century writer tells us of [multi-lingual] Iraqi Jews who criss-crossed Eurasia, travelling between France and China (covering Muslim lands, southern Russia, and India along the way), and the discovery of thousands of Abbasid coins in Scandinavia attests to the scope of this commercial activity. Even the spread of papermaking from China to the Near East is instructive in this context: our sources tell us that Muslims defeated a Chinese army in 751, capturing papermakers in the process from whom they learned the techniques themselves. What is interesting is that such hostile circumstances – a bloody battle in Central Asia – did little to hinder cross-cultural interaction and the spread of commodities, people, and ideas.\"\n"

"Before answering the question below, read the following passage:\n"
"\n"
"> \"The intellectual and physical, geographic aspects of the crusade’s influence on European expansion cannot neatly be separated. Neither should it be exaggerated. The creation of Asiatic empires and the altering of trade routes; the development of the European economy, technology and commerce; or the transmission of classical and Arabic texts via Spain, Sicily, southern Italy and Byzantium ran distinct and parallel to the effects of the wars of the cross. However, crusading idealism led to significant political settlements of Latin Christians in the Near East and, in places, an obsessive European concern for western Asia and the Eastern Mediterranean that would not have developed in the way it did with the distinctive dynamism of the crusade mentality and tradition. Politically, the nature of the Muslim powers of the Near East mattered to Frankish rulers and warriors.\" \n"

Luther also held that faith alone was the path to salvation, rejecting the Church’s idea that one could speed one’s way to heaven by undertaking good works (charitable activities).
