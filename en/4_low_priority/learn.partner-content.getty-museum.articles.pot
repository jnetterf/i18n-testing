"**1\\. Cartoon**  \n"
"An artist would initially make a sketch of the overall composition of a window. Then full-sized drawings for the whole window or for different sections (panels) of the window were made. These full-sized drawings are called cartoons. Generally, the shapes of the individual glass pieces, the details to be painted, and the colors of the glass were indicated on the cartoon. In the early Middle Ages these were drawn on whitewashed boards."

"**5\\. glazing**  \n"
"“Glazing” is the term for assembling a panel of stained glass that can then be set into a window. After separate pieces of glass are painted and fired, they are placed in position on the cartoon and joined together with lead came to form a panel. In the Middle Ages, a combination knife and hammer was used for this process. The knife edge was used to cut the pieces of came and the hammer end was used to secure nails to the work board to hold the edges in place during assembly."

"The panel is then cemented to help secure the glass within the leads and to waterproof the window. A semi-liquid cement is applied with a brush and then is covered with a layer of chalk or sawdust to absorb excess liquid. The medieval recipe for this cement is not known, though the main ingredients were probably crushed chalk and linseed oil. The panel is then scrubbed down with a dry brush until the cement only remains under the lead."

It may seem surprising to call stained glass a form of painting, but in fact it is. Look closely at the image here and note that the surfaces of each piece of glass are painted in a wide range of dark tones. One of the most widespread forms of painting, stained glass inspired the lives of the faithful through religious narratives in churches and cloisters, celebrated family and political ties in city halls, and even decorated the windows of private houses."

msgid "Some of the most powerful art produced in the High Middle Ages were stained-glass cycles, or visual stories, in French cathedrals. Among the most famous of these is in Reims Cathedral, from which this arresting lunette (a half moon–shape) originally came. The seraph, one of the six-winged angels that were thought to stand in the presence of God, is frighteningly formal, with thick strokes of black vitreous paint used to render its commanding eyes and facial features. Vitreous paint is paint that contains tiny glass particles mixed in a liquid."

msgid "The production of large-scale stained-glass windows for churches flourished in Europe during the Renaissance. These two monumental examples (left) probably once decorated a chapel. On the left is a Crucifixion scene with the Virgin and St. John the Evangelist, and on the right is a young kneeling donor. As he adores The Crucifixion, the donor is protected by Saint Christopher, the giant who ferried the Christ child over a river. The brilliant color and complex workmanship of these panels indicate that they were a lavish expression of piety on the part of the young, unidentified donor."

msgid "The term stained glass derives from the silver stain that was often applied to the side of the window that would face the outside of the building. When the glass was fired, the silver stain turned a yellow color that could range from lemon to gold. Stained glass was usually used to make windows, so that the light would shine through the painting. It is a form of painting that began over 1,000 years ago and is still essentially made the same way today."

msgid "This window was originally meant to go up high, in the windows of a cloister, and even though the piece itself is rather small, the tremendous clarity of the line-work that makes it quite legible from a distance. The beautiful curls of the hair, the  facial features, are all painted in a black line of vitreous paint by an individual who expresses himself just as surely in this art form as a painter of oil or tempera would express him or her self in a panel painting or a fresco painting. The paint, which is applied to the glass surface, adds detail and a sense of three-dimensionality to the image. Another unique aspect of stained glass is that it's enhanced by daylight, which changes with the weather, the season, and the time of day. When a glass panel is shot through with a strong ray of light, you can see the colors floating off the top of the panel, and this is what makes it such a moving, and almost mystical, art form."

The painting demonstrates how pure, supple lines communicate tenderness and delicacy, even when viewed from a distance, as was often the case with medieval church glass. Simple fields of color (including the silver stain used in the yellow halos) complete the radiant effect."

msgid "​During the late 1400s glass windows in domestic interiors became ubiquitous, and small painted roundels like this one—a single piece of clear glass with vitreous paint and golden silver stain—became so popular that their production reached nearly industrial proportions by the 1520s. Purchased in large cycles or as single images, they were intended to amuse and instruct, with subjects like zodiac signs, religious imagery, portraits, and heraldry."

msgid "For the robes, de los Arcos undertook an additional series of steps applying and then reducing materials using the _estofado_ technique whereby the artist scratched through a paint layer to reveal another layer of contrasting color or material below (see panel below). To begin this process the artist would first apply bole to the finished wooden sculpture. Bole is a traditional clay material that could be sanded down and burnished with a stone to produce an attractive, smooth surface. Sheets of gold leaf would then be applied over the bole, followed by two layers of grey-and-brown tempera paint to create color variation on the surface of the gold leaf. De los Arcos would then carefully draw a pattern onto the darkened surface, and systematically scratch surface layers away to reveal the brilliant gold material beneath it. The work was finished by making small indentations inside the gold pattern to give it a greater appearance of depth and create more variation in the surface."

msgid "The intricate pattern and highly realistic details on the figure’s face (left) and hands were all created through the process of polychroming, or the decoration of a surface in many colors. Overall, _Saint Ginés de la Jara_ is stunningly lifelike in appearance. His active pose enhances the sensation of motion, and the delicacy of the carving combined with the expertly applied details in his face, hair, skin, and clothes make for an overwhelming impression of liveliness."

msgid "There is also much to be learned from the painting on _Saint Ginés de la Jara_. Getty researchers determined how Tomás de los Arcos undertook a painstaking process to both protect the wood’s surface and ensure the realism of the final painting. The artist began by coating the entire sculpture with a type of glue to cure and preserve it, and then applied layers of gesso (_yeso grueso_ and _yeso mate_), which is a binding agent that is also applied to canvas before painting to provide an even and protected surface for paint. The hands, feet, and head were then finished with layers of oil paint—the _encarnaciones_ technique of painting flesh tones (shown below)."

msgid "In the ancient Greek world, wine was drunk from bowls like this one. The ancient Greeks didn't drink their wine neat, as we say, they actually diluted it with water because it was much stronger than the wine that we drink today. This bowl doesn't really have a flat base, or a foot, to sit it on. So once you had finished, you had to turn it upside down, and rest it on its rim. This upside-down position showcases the bowl's petal-shaped knobs and decorative ridges. Glass at this time, in the third and second century B.C.E., was very much considered a luxury object. Bowls like this were for those who could afford luxury materials, like silver, and gold. In a Greek household, this bowl would likely have been reserved for the man of the house. These were vessel shapes that were used at drinking parties; only men went to these drinking parties. Women were not included. But often times a piece like this would stay in a family for generations as an heirloom, and many of these pieces survive today because they were placed in tombs as grave gifts for the deceased."

msgid "Shaped as the head of a young man, this vessel is known as a \"head flask.\" Head flasks were extremely popular in ancient Rome and have a long history. Making vessels shaped as heads is something that has been practiced for millennia. With its long neck and slightly flared mouth, the flask was probably used to hold and pour liquid. Over the centuries, the object's appearance has changed. If you look closely at the neck of this flask and the right side of the head, you can see a flaky layer on the surface that has a rainbow-like appearance. This is called iridescence and it is a side effect of the glass as it ages and weathers. It is something that inspired modern glassmakers like Tiffany, when he was making his stained glass, lamps, and other vessels."

msgid "The Romans loved glass for its practical as well as decorative uses. This beautifully preserved decanter is a fine example of the virtually colorless glass that came to dominate the market by the 3rd century C.E.. When it was made, the flask's surface would have been shiny and highly polished. Its dull appearance now is the result of age and weathering. The flat, opaque, blue and white glass ribbons that trail around the bulbous body of the flask are known as \"snake-thread.\" This practice of trailing on glass strands was a common Roman decorative technique. But the distinctive blue and white snake-thread pattern on this vessel was common to only two areas: one near Cologne, in modern Germany. And the other, in the eastern provinces of the Roman empire. This flask probably comes from the east. The 'flower and bird' motif of flattened leaves spreading out from twisting stems is an eastern provinces design. The cross hatching definition on the leaves, rather than simple lines, also points to the flask's eastern origins."

msgid "These blue-and-white, cameo-glass objects are among the rarest objects in the Antiquities Collection. Only about thirty Roman cameo-glass vessels survive intact today. The two-handled drinking cup is called a skyphos, and likely held perfume. Cameo glassmakers carved away an opaque, white layer to expose the cobalt-blue glass underneath. The glass maker began with a gather of the blue glass (a gather is a gob of molten glass), and blew into the blow pipe to inflate the glass. Once he had some air in the gather, he dipped it into white glass and made sure that it adhered to the blue glass. This is a very complicated procedure, because the glasses must be at very similar temperatures. Then the glassmaker put his blow pipe back into the glass furnace to reheat the glass, and started inflating it again until he got it more or less the size of vessel he wanted."

It was not made by inflating glass, but rather by core forming—wrapping hot molten glass around a temporary earthenware shape. The surface pattern is called \"combing,\" a wavy or feathery effect created by applying trails of molten glass of a contrasting color to the vessel's body, then dragging at right angles with a pointed tool."

msgid "What's unusual about this flask is that it has a spout emerging from the shoulder. And you can see, if you look closely at that spout, that it actually has a very narrow opening. The spout was probably used to pour oil into oil lamps. When this piece was made,  in the first century B.C.E. or C.E., glass was beginning to replace clay and metal vessels in households. A vessel like this was in the kitchen of a typical middle-class Roman household. This flask was created by inflating glass at the end of a blowpipe. The discovery of glass blowing-in the first century B.C.E. made glass cheaper and much more widely available. Opaque glass vessels were also extremely fashionable. To achieve the opaque effect, the glassmaker added lead to the hot glass as it was being made. One of the things that opaque glass vessels do—and particularly a piece like this that has darker stripes in the glass—is to imitate another material. It may be that the glassmaker who made this little flask was intending to imitate a stone vessel."

msgid "> an amorphous, inorganic substance made by fusing silica (silicon dioxide) with a basic oxide; generally transparent but often translucent or opaque. Its characteristic properties are its hardness and rigidity at ordinary temperatures, its capacity for plastic working at elevated temperatures, and its resistance to weathering and to most chemicals except hydrofluoric acid. Used for both utilitarian and decorative purposes, it can be formed into various shapes, colored or decorated. Glass originated as a glaze in Mesopotamia in about 3500 BCE and the first objects made wholly of glass date to about 2500 BC."

msgid "Dioskourides (active 65–30 B.C.), a Greek master from Aigeai in Asia Minor (present-day Turkey), is one of the few gem carvers recorded in ancient literature. He is mentioned by several Roman authors as the carver of the personal seal of the emperor Augustus (ruled 27 B.C.–A.D. 14). Several high-quality intaglios and cameos bear the signatures of Dioskourides and his sons, Eutyches, Hyllos, and Herophilos, who followed him in the trade. Dioskourides' fame led later carvers to copy his works and forge his signature."

Later Julius Caesar dedicated six gem cabinets in the Temple of Venus. A gem cabinet was called a _daktyliotheke_."

msgid "It is the storytelling aspect of vase-painting that readily captures our imagination. This is especially true when a picture is dramatic, such as the one inside this **kylix** (a shallow bowl for drinking), shown below, where we witness Tekmessa’s discovery of the body of the dead warrior Ajax. Although Ajax was the strongest of the Greeks who participated in the Trojan War, he did not die gloriously in battle. Tragic events beyond his control forced him to commit suicide. Ajax set his sword upright in the pebbly beach at Troy and threw himself upon it."

msgid "Looking at a vase begins with its shape, whose structure is likened to human anatomy: mouth, neck, shoulder, body, and foot. The Greeks called the handles “ears.” Pots were not always made in one piece but were thrown in separate sections that were joined together by the potter. The separate parts are revealed by the changing contours of the shape."

msgid "More than any other element, the pictures are the most important decorations on vases. The Greeks delighted in images—men and women, gods and heroes, children, and all manner of animals or creatures—but their idea of realism was by no means identical to ours. They depicted human and mythological figures unceasingly, yet all but ignored representing the world in which they moved. Landscapes and buildings are rarely more than props. Generally, pictures have no substantial depth or perspective beyond the sense of foreground and background created by overlapping or by arranging figures on more than one level."

msgid "Observe the sections of the neck-amphora shown in the image below, a typical example of this shape. Notice the mouth and neck (thrown as one piece), handles (made separately and attached), shoulder and body (also thrown as one), and foot. The mouth and foot are the vase’s upper and lower borders. The neck-amphora’s vertical handles are the side borders that mark the horizontal limits beyond which the painted figures in the picture do not extend. The vertical patterns on the neck and under the figures are especially important, for they visually link the picture and the body to the adjacent parts of the vase, to the mouth and neck above, and to the foot below."

msgid "The limited colors seen on vases were by no means the only ones known to the Greeks, who employed a broad range of naturalistic colors in paintings on walls and wooden panels, very few of which have survived. Of the four colors seen on vases (black, orange-red, purple-red, and white), black and orange-red proved to be especially durable. Like the fired clay itself, they were able to withstand the high heat of the **kiln**, the wear-and-tear of everyday use, and centuries of burial. Even breakage will not destroy vases completely. Surviving vase fragments can be both beautiful and instructive."

msgid "The vases were decorated by painters who worked in several techniques, of which the two principal ones were black-figure and red-figure. In both of these techniques, two colors predominate: a deep orange-red and a shiny, metallic-looking black. The black-figure technique was developed by about 700 B.C. in Corinth. The black figures were painted as silhouettes that stand out against the orange-red clay surface of the vase. Details were either incised through the black to the red clay surface below, or added in colors. This technique was not adopted by vase-painters in Athens until about 620 B.C. Red-figure made its appearance about one hundred years later, invented in Athens about 530 B.C. Essentially, red-figure is the reverse of black-figure. The background is painted black, the figures are left the orange-red color of the clay, and, for the most part, details are painted in black."

Ceramic vases served as containers, either for utilitarian purposes in the home or for religious rituals. Some vases were decorated with figures and patterns, others were plain and painted black all over, and unpainted coarse ware sufficed for cooking."

msgid "While the imagery on Greek vases is extremely varied, the pictures offer neither a complete nor balanced view of society. Few of the many slaves and foreigners who resided in Athens are depicted. Women and children are shown only in a very limited number of roles; pictures of family life are rare. The very active political and intellectual life of the Greeks is almost entirely absent. Images of famous persons are virtually unknown, and no contemporary events of any historical significance are depicted. These omissions are significant gaps. Nevertheless, what vase-painters chose to portray shows us so much of their world in lively, intimately detailed, and often remarkably beautiful pictures, that vase-paintings enable us to experience ancient Greece with our own eyes."

msgid "[[☃ image 1]] Nothing is more fundamental to the aesthetic of Greek vase-painting than the interplay and balance between the contrasting dark and light areas on a vase, that is, between the black painted areas and the orange-red of the unpainted clay. Look again at the image above, but this time with the balance of light and dark in mind. The black is concentrated in the picture, and the picture dominates the vase. Observe, too, that the image is located on the widest part of the body and takes up most of the space on the vase. This location on the vase afforded the painter the largest surface on which to create the picture. Thus, the main pictorial zone occupies the widest part of most Greek vase shapes."

"**BURNISHING**  \n"
"Burnishing is an essential step in creating a perfectly smooth surface on the vase in preparation for painting. When the clay is leather-hard, the surface of the vase is vigorously rubbed with a hard, smooth object, most likely made of leather, wood, or smooth stone. The process of burnishing compacts and smoothes the surface of the clay, making it shiny and less susceptible to abrasion."

"**TURNING AND JOINING**  \n"
"Turning is the process of trimming and removing superfluous or uneven clay in order to refine the shape of a vase or reduce the thickness of its walls after it has been thrown. When the vase has dried to a leather-hard state, it is centered on the wheel again if the shape has to be refined. While the vase rotates, various tools made of wood, metal, or bone are used to trim and refine the shape. Extra clay is removed, and the surface is smoothed with a wet sponge or leather. Details such as grooves can be made at this stage. If the vase has been made in sections, they are now joined, and the whole vase is turned on the wheel."

msgid "[[☃ image 1]] To paint a vase in black-figure technique, its surface was first burnished and polished. Then an **ocher** wash might have been applied to ensure an attractive orange-red color, and the surface burnished again. A preliminary sketch outlined the design of the figures, which were then filled in with black. Red or white colors were sometimes applied on top of the black. Before firing, incisions were made through the black gloss, or the colors, with a sharp, pointed tool to delineate details of the figures in the lighter color of the underlying clay. White, produced from fine white clay, was used for the skin of women, details of clothes, shields, furniture, etc. Red (purple and brown tints made of red iron oxide) was frequently used on black-figured vases for garments, blood, inscriptions, wreaths, bands, and other details. White and red colors were usually applied over the black silhouette."

To create a mold, an original model (or prototype) is sculpted, and a mold consisting of two or more sections is made around it. Fired clay was a common material for molds in antiquity. The fingerprints seen on the interior walls of plastic vases are evidence that Greek craftsmen pressed soft clay carefully into the interior of molds. We know of a number of plastic vases by Sotades, the Brygos Painter, and Euphronios, both of whom signed their work."

msgid "Ancient silversmiths employed a variety of sophisticated techniques to fashion the multiple parts of a drinking cup. The cups were formed from two main components: a smooth inner liner—hammered into shape and annealed (heated and cooled) as needed to keep the silver pliable—and a similar outer shell. The craftsman executed the figural decoration on the exterior of the outer shell, first by working from inside, raising and shaping the general forms of the figures with a rounded tool. This process is called _repoussé_—French for “pushed out.” To define the figures more clearly, the silversmith then worked from the outside, delineating edges and adding details with a variety of fine tools. This is what the silversmith Publius is doing in his grave relief, shown above. The inner liner of the cup was inserted into the outer shell once the shell’s exterior relief was finished. The feet and handles were made (cast) separately and soldered on to the completed, joined cup and liner."

msgid "As their empire expanded in the last centuries B.C., the ancient Romans amassed great wealth and developed a taste for luxurious objects fashioned from precious materials. Domestic opulence and personal adornment were markers of status, leisure, and refinement. Elite individuals dined from finely wrought silver vessels, many of which were decorated in the Greek style with mythological scenes, adding cultural cachet to their monetary value. These treasures not only demonstrate the skills of Roman craftsmen but also provide valuable information about social relations at the height of the Empire. Ancient literature and archaeological finds attest to the use of objects not just in daily (though not necessarily everyday) life but also as grave gifts, and as dedications to the gods. A single object might in the course of its life fulfill more than one function."

Odysseus traveled to Hades, the land of the dead, to consult the ghost of the blind seer Teiresias, who told him when he would finally return home to Ithaka. The blood of the sacrificed ram has summoned the dead, and Teiresias and another ghost are shown sitting on nearby rocks. The other side of this two-handled drinking cup shows five conversing male figures, probably philosophers."

msgid "Silver drinking cups with relief decoration were very popular in the 1st centuries B.C. and A.D. Cups were sometimes made in pairs to encourage conversation about the scenes on the vessels. Cupids, scenes of Bacchus, the Roman god of wine (Greek Dionysos), and mythological narratives—appropriate for the pleasant gatherings at which they would be seen and discussed—decorated most Roman tableware. Philosophical and political themes also appeared on silver vessels, as did pastoral and hunting scenes. Such imagery signaled the culture of their owner and stimulated intellectual conversation during and after dining. When not in use, the vessels were sometimes prominently displayed."

It was one of a pair dedicated by a Roman man, Quintus Domitius Tutus, to Mercury at a sanctuary to the god in Gaul. This and other silver vessels dedicated by Quintus depict Bacchic themes and mythological episodes not associated with Mercury, such as the Trojan War. The vessels, possibly heirlooms, do not seem likely to have been made with Mercury in mind, and they were probably used by Tutus as drinking or display wares before he offered them to the god."

Luxury goods like these were not just the possessions of emperors and senators, but were also available to the wealthy. Wearing an inscribed gemstone or drinking from silver cups with one’s dinner guests was not only an act of conspicuous consumption, but was also a sign of adherence to a larger, widespread culture. Despite the disapproval of Roman moralists and early Christian writers who attacked Roman decadence, the luxury arts were clearly highly valued, and many of the artisans who produced them—whether slave or free—were masters of their craft."

Birds perch on and hover over the garland, while musical instruments associated with the cult of the god Bacchus hang from it.

Along with firelight, candles were the only sources of illumination after dark; thus, candelabra, wall-mounted lights, as seen below, and chandeliers abounded. These objects were often gilded, not only to heighten their splendor, but also to reflect the candlelight and illuminate the room."

Some of the finest examples in the collection include a series of tapestries, lighting implements, silver pieces, and two magnificent beds."

msgid "The bed shown below is called a_lit à la Turque_ (Turkish bed). This title does not refer to any specific Turkish design source but reflects the 18th-century preoccupation with anything exotic and unusual from foreign countries. This unusually large bed was made for a bedroom in a grand private residence. It would have been placed sideways against a wall, with a draped baldachin (ornamental canopy) now missing. The wheels underneath the bed allowed servants to pull out the body of the bed easily, leaving the tall back attached to the wall while they made the bed. It was probably set into an alcove or niche in a bedroom wall."

They were the first tapestries to be created around a _chinoiserie_ theme, in which Westerners employed exotic Chinese forms combined with European motifs. The tapestries feature Emperor Shunzhi (1638–61) and his wife. They are both featured in the image below left, admiring a large pile of game. In the center tapestry, the mustached emperor confers with local and international scientists around a large globe and armillary sphere. The panel at the right displays a woman, possibly the empress, gesturing with her fan at a lush landscape of pineapple plants."

This style can be recognized by its curving lines, gilded embellishments, and influence from nature. The framework for the _lit à la Polonaise_ is also hand-carved and gilded, but the lines and forms are entirely different. Tastes had changed in the twenty-five years between the creation of the beds, and artists had moved from the Rococo to what was later called the Neoclassical style. The curvaceous Rococo leaves, tendrils, and shell shapes seen in the earlier bed, below left, gave way to straight lines and influences from the classical past, such as the \"egg-and-dart\" decoration and laurel leaves on the baldachin, below right."

msgid "Italian maiolica was developed during the Renaissance, beginning in the 1400s. The use of a tin glaze on ceramics was an innovation introduced to Italian artists via pottery imported from Spain. At the time, Spain was predominantly under Moorish rule, and much of the pottery being exported was what is referred to as Hispano-Moresque in style. The basin seen below is an example of Hispano-Moresque ceramics, combining Islamic and European elements of design. The name \"maiolica\" originated either from Majorca, the Spanish island port through which many of the Hispano-Moresque ceramics were imported to Italy, or from the Spanish term _obra de Málaga_, which refers to wares imported from Málaga, Spain."

msgid "Maiolica is a form of Italian pottery made of tin-glazed earthenware that was popular from the 1400s to the 1600s. Maiolica can be distinguished by a white background that contrasts with the brilliant earth-tone pigments painted onto it. The tin glaze is a chemical mixture that acts as a base for paint by fixing it to the surface, giving maiolica pottery its unique white background. The presence of tin in a glaze makes the glaze less likely to run or blur when the painted ceramic piece is heated in a kiln. Artists took advantage of this quality and used tin glazes for making pottery with finely detailed, painted decorations, as seen in the image below. The tin glaze preserves colors incredibly well over time, so maiolica is unique in that its brilliant colors may appear just as they did when they were originally painted hundreds of years ago."

msgid "Once the clay is formed into the desired shape, it is fired in a kiln. A kiln is an extremely hot oven used specifically for hardening ceramics. Traditional kilns were heated with a wood-burning fire. Fires produce ash, smoke and gas, which can damage vessels. To avoid such damage, Renaissance potters would place fine vessels inside a special refractory clay container that better withstood extremely high temperatures."

msgid "The majority of maiolica pieces that remain today are of fine quality. These high-end works, such as the elaborately decorated basin seen below, were typically used only for display or special occasions. This basin was possibly made by or in the workshop of Orazio Fontana, who was one of the most sought-after and innovative ceramicists active in mid-16th-century Italy. He helped develop a new genre of maiolica directly inspired by Raphael’s frescos, and this basin depicting a Greek mythological scene reflects the ornate style of many 16th-century maiolica wares. The unique qualities of maiolica production and design have allowed stunning examples of this form of decorative arts to survive since the Renaissance."

He wrote three volumes on maiolica production entitled _The Three Books of the Potter’s Art_, published in 1577\\. Thanks to Piccolpasso, we are able to reconstruct contemporary methods of gathering and forming clay, making and applying glazes, and firing ceramic pieces, as demonstrated in the video [_Making Maiolica_](/partner-content/getty-museum/getty-sculpture/v/making-maiolica)."

msgid "[[☃ image 1]]Maiolica is made by first sourcing clay from the earth and kneading it into consistent mass to eliminate air. To begin forming the clay into a shape, also known as the process of \"throwing,\" potters use a spinning circular platform. This device has a circular base which the potter controls by foot in order to keep a consistent speed. The potter centers the clay on the spinning wheel, exerting pressure by hand to form the shape of the clay object. Sometimes molds are used in order to duplicate an existing ceramic design like a plate. When throwing clay using a mold, the potter will first center the mold on the wheel, and then center the clay mass over the mold and press it into the mold. Potters sometimes rest their hands on a bar extended over the wheel in order to keep them steady while removing excess clay to make it uniform over the mold."

In 1672, Boulle rose from master cabinetmaker to _ébéniste du roi,_ royal cabinetmaker and sculptor to King Louis XIV, known as the “Sun King.” That same year, the king granted him the royal privilege of lodging in the Palais du Louvre. This position allowed Boulle to produce furniture as well as works in gilt bronze, such as chandeliers, wall lights, and mounts for furniture. Although strict guild rules usually prevented craftsmen from practicing two professions simultaneously, Boulle's favored position allowed him protected status and exempted him from these statutes. Boulle’s specialty was wood pictorial marquetry, and he was so skilled he became known as a “painter in wood.”"

msgid "During the first years of the 18th century in France, the design of furniture evolved, but marquetry remained largely in the style of André-Charles Boulle, cabinetmaker to the king from 1672\\. Then throughout the reign of Louis XV (1715–1774), furniture changed considerably with the elegance and originality of curved forms that allowed for more fantasy and a greater variety of decoration. Marquetry designs were easily adapted to this new style by taking full advantage of the rich assortment of natural wood tones and the lively colors of dyed woods. One great marquetry master who dominated the middle of the 18th century in Paris was Jean-François Oeben (1721–1763). However, cabinetmakers, or _ébénistes_, were not only prevalent in France. In other parts of Europe, including Germany and Italy, extravagant pieces emerged from the workshops of Abraham Roentgen and Francesco Abbiati."

He later was stationed at the Arsenal in Paris, where he was granted permission to build a forge to cast his own metal fittings."

msgid "Throughout the 1700s in Europe, the making of furniture was an elaborate process involving a variety of craftsmen, from the cabinetmaker to the bronze founder to the finisher. The environment of these artisans, their training, neighborhoods, design sources, and patrons all combined to influence the final products. Much of the veneered furniture in the J. Paul Getty Museum’s collection is the result of this collaboration."

msgid "While Oeben gained popularity in France, Germany also celebrated its native cabinetmaker, Abraham Roentgen (1711–1793). He established a furniture workshop near Neuwied, south of Cologne, and soon became known for furniture of outstanding quality that was admired for its interesting use of inlay, inventive mechanical fittings, and the hidden drawers he used in his furniture. Roentgen’s son, David, succeeded him in 1772, and the two then worked in partnership until Abraham retired in 1784."

msgid "[[☃ image 1]] Oeben soon specialized in small, elaborately fitted, multi-purpose pieces of furniture with mechanical parts. He is also credited with having reintroduced naturalistic floral marquetry, which had fallen out of fashion. He produced furniture for the most fashionable members of the aristocracy and was patronized by Madame de Pompadour, Louis XV's mistress. Oeben executed his work with considerable artistic taste and was an innovator in the use of intricate compositions, which is evident in the Getty Museum’s _Writing and Toilette Table_, seen above, from about 1754."

msgid "A drawing can be broadly defined as a work of art executed by hand in drawing media on paper. However, there is much blurring at the edges of this definition. For example, drawings can be made on vellum (animal skin), as are works that are considered manuscript illuminations, and large highly finished pastels on paper are often considered paintings. Rough oil sketches on canvas or paper are another gray area, some being mounted as drawings and some presented as paintings—a minority were also made as independent works of art. These were often highly finished and highly colored, and deliberately meant to mimic paintings. The uniqueness of drawings and paintings distinguishes them from prints, which are intended to be produced in multiple impressions by a variety of processes, including woodcut, engraving, and etching."

msgid "One of the prime considerations when looking at a drawing is that of why it was originally made. Asking this question can help us understand why it takes the form it does, and why the artist might have chosen a particular format or medium—a pen or chalk, for instance. Did the artist intend other people to see it? Was it to be followed by other drawings? For example, artists used drawings to work out the placement of characters within a scene, such as in a compositional study, or to examine a particular aspect of the design, such as lighting of a single figure or a detail of dress or expression."

As we engage with these works, we can almost hear the pen-scratch across the sheet or feel that we are seeing three-dimensional space being created with chalk on a blank piece of paper. Master drawings provide a glimpse behind the scenes, beyond the final product the artist wanted us to see, enabling us to understand the human struggle involved, false starts and failed ideas included. The centuries of time between us and the artists seem to drop away, and we are there beside them as they work."

Called the _Vidal Mayor_, the book includes laws devoted to a variety of issues, from the legal rights of orphans to those of women leaving their husbands. One particularly beautiful page (shown above) shows a historiated initial _E_ framing two scenes in a sequential narrative. Depicted in the upper portion of the letter _E_, an enthroned king listens to a dispute between a creditor and debtor. Below, two figures engage in combat, watched by the king. The cross on one combatant's vestment identifies him as a Christian, while the crescent shape on the other's tunic suggests he is Muslim or at the very least a foreigner. The repetition of the figure of the king on both levels suggests that the battle relates to the argument above. The background is covered in pure gold leaf, which adds a luxuriousness and level of importance to the scene."

A renewed interest in the natural world in the 1200s ensured a prominent place for astronomy in the growing universities of Europe. The collection of scientific theories about the constellations and other scholarly texts was probably compiled as a textbook for a university audience. The constellations and signs of the zodiac were rendered in a pen-and-ink technique, lending liveliness to the depiction of the positions of the stars in the sky. On the page at the left, we can recognize several constellations in today’s sky, including Pisces (two fish), Aquarius (the water bearer), and Aries (the ram)."

The word manuscript is derived from the Latin words _manus_ (hand) and _scriptus_, from _scribere_ (to write). Illuminated, from the Latin _illuminare_ (to light up), denotes the glow created by the radiant colors of the illustrations, as well as by real gold and silver. Illuminations took the form of decorated letters, borders, and independent figurative scenes, also called miniatures."

Though sumptuously decorated with incredible detail, the book is only about four-inches tall. Illuminated largely by Italian artist Taddeo Crivelli, these two pages in particular demonstrate superb examples of miniature and border illumination, complete with a historiated initial (a letter containing identifiable narrative scenes or figures). The miniature on the left-hand page shows the Angel Gabriel and the Virgin Mary surrounded by naturalistic elements. Flowers, peacocks, and trees crowd the border, interspersed with Renaissance heraldic symbols and the personal mottoes of the book’s owner. Facing this page, the Virgin and Child embrace within a historiated initial _D_, flanked by the first prayers of the day, in Latin. Taken from Psalm 50, the text reads: _Domine labia mea aperies et os meus an[n]utiabit laudem tuam_ (Lord, you will open my lips, and my mouth will declare your praise)."

Holy figures were placed against gold backgrounds to suggest their proximity to God. _**Sgraffito**_ is the Italian word meaning “scratched.” A layer of paint over the gold was scratched off in small patterned areas to create effects such as gold brocade fabric. **Tools and punch marks** created the indented floral, leaf, and geometric patterns impressed upon the gold. Some were punched with a carved tool, while others were done freehand. These patterns can occasionally be associated with an individual workshop.

He took great pains to include details such as attributes for saints on the side wings and landscapes in most of the predella panels. The opulence and sheer elaborateness of this altarpiece inspired awe in Christian viewers of the late 1300s, and remain impressive today."

msgid "After looking carefully at an image and describing it objectively, the next step is formal analysis. Formal analysis relies upon the elements of composition (e.g., line, color, texture, balance, proportion, etc.). A good place to start is deciding which elements are most strongly represented. In the photograph of Lincoln, the very distinct lines and geometric shapes are immediately apparent. Upon closer inspection, it is clear that these lines and shapes function to frame and to move the viewer's eye toward the central subject, President Lincoln. For instance, note the way that all of the lines in the image draw the eye toward the figure of the president. The tent forms an inverted \"V\" shape directly behind Lincoln while the vertical tent post and tree trunk in the background further elongate Lincoln's already tall figure, clearly emphasizing Lincoln's figure in the composition."

msgid "At the time Emerson was working, the question of whether photographs should be in or out of focus—sharp or soft—was the subject of intense and occasionally angry debate within photographic circles. One school believed that photography’s defining characteristic was its ability to capture detail with clarity. Others felt that selecting the degree of focus in different parts of the photograph—using a technique known as **differential focus**—resulted in an image that was, in fact, closer to the effects that a human eye can perceive."

msgid "Emerson was often drawn to the uninhabited landscape—the flat marshland, the stretch of sky and water only occasionally disrupted by a rooftop or a sail. In his _Naturalistic Photography for Students of the Art,_ he decreed that landscape itself could be a subject and source for inspiration: “Nature is full of pictures, and they are to be found in what appears to the uninitiated the most unlikely places.” At first glance, many of Emerson’s photographs seem empty. He ignored the crowds of tourists and amusements along the Norfolk Broads, as well as the fact that the region’s agriculture was failing. Instead, he turned his gaze to other aspects of the landscape, remaining engaged with nature."

Emerson saw himself as an anthropologist of types. Through his photographs of East Anglian hunters, gamekeepers, farmworkers, and fishermen (see image below), he hoped to preserve, at least photographically, the traditional ways of life, which he believed were at risk of becoming obsolete with industrialization and the rise of tourism. His images presented idealized types that reflected his subjective vision of the countryside."

msgid "Peter Henry Emerson (1856–1936) championed a style of photography he referred to as “naturalistic.” A British citizen, Emerson was born in Cuba and spent part of his childhood in the United States. Traveling among different regions was not only central to his upbringing, but was also an important component of his work as an adult. Quoting the poet John Keats, Emerson asserted, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty,” on the title page of his 1889 treatise _Naturalistic Photography for Students of the Art_, arguing that art should imitate nature. In his photographs, Emerson rejected prevailing methods and subjects in favor of an approach that employed selective focus and used only a single negative to realize his prints, rather than combining negatives to create an image. His views sparked heated debate among photographers and critics, but Emerson passionately defended his approach as more realistic and truer to nature."

In keeping with the then-current scientific ideas about vision, he maintained that the human eye rarely sees anything fully in focus. Emerson therefore manipulated his camera’s focal plane to create areas in and out of focus. In addition, he advocated working outdoors in nature and composing the scene in the camera with a single shot. Emerson called his style of photography **naturalistic**, as it was taken from nature and left unretouched."

Emerson favored the relatively new medium because his photographs could be reproduced in a manner that reflected his vision for naturalistic photography. His photogravure prints influenced a later generation of photographers, including Edward Steichen and Alfred Stieglitz, who took inspiration from the rich body of work Emerson produced from the late 1880s through the mid-1890s."

msgid "[[☃ image 1]]_Gathering Water-Lilies_, shown above, is arguably Emerson’s best known photograph and certainly his most widely reproduced. Originally realized as an albumen silver print, the image was subsequently published as a photogravure in two highly successful editions before he produced the platinum version for _Life and Landscape on the Norfolk Broads_, his 1886 publication with the painter T.F. Goodall. The subject, while seemingly peaceful and romantic, actually records two people working collecting flowers to use as bait for fishing. This context did not become clear until Emerson included the image in his book, which documented the various traditions of the people who worked the Norfolk Broads, a wetlands region on the coast northeast of London. To create the book, Emerson interacted with the locals, recorded their traditions, and presented a view of the countryside that was aimed at “lovers of art.”"

msgid "A photograph is the result of a unique set of choices the artist makes. One of the most important decisions involves what materials (or mediums) to use when printing. Photographers employ different kinds of surfaces—metal, paper, glass, and flexible film—that are treated with light-sensitive chemicals to record images. These chemicals affect surface texture, sharpness of detail, color, and tone. Two of the first types of photographic mediums to gain prominence were **daguerreotypes** and **salted paper prints**."

msgid "Daguerreotypes and salted paper prints were popular throughout the mid-1800s, but neither was able to fully eclipse the other. The daguerreotype process offered higher resolution, while the negative-positive process offered reproducibility. One was hand-held, while the other could be easily mailed or included in books. As further experimentation with photographic media advanced, photographers continued to seek methods that would combine and extend the best features of each practice. Both daguerreotypes and salted paper prints, though still created periodically, were supplanted by albumen silver prints, a new photographic medium of choice."

msgid "Highly vulnerable to physical damage from abrasion and chemical damage from tarnishing, daguerreotypes were usually protected with a metal mat and a covering sheet of glass. This construction was then sealed with tape and fitted into a book-like case made of leather-covered wood or an early form of plastic (compressed sawdust and resin). Cases were often lined with dark velvet (shown below). As the finished daguerreotype image lies on the surface of a highly polished plate, it must be held at an angle to minimize reflections. The experience of viewing a daguerreotype is intimate. Holding this image of Poe gives the sensation of staring directly into his eyes, yet the surface of the plate is mirrored so you see yourself staring back."

msgid "William Henry Fox Talbot (1800–77) developed a process that produced a paper negative, from which photographic images on paper were printed. Popular until roughly 1860, early paper prints were made on high-quality writing paper, which gave the prints a matte surface with visible paper texture (shown below). During this time, photographers who created paper photographs using negative-positive techniques competed with daguerreotype photographers for attention. Although daguerreotypes were more detailed, they had to be made one at a time and were each unique. The process introduced by Talbot offered the opportunity to produce multiple prints from a single negative."

msgid "[[☃ image 1]]In the early 1840s, Talbot refined a negative-positive process that produced photographic images on salted paper. Now generally referred to as a salted paper print, it was made by sensitizing a sheet of paper in a solution of salt (sodium chloride), and then coating it on one side with silver nitrate. Light-sensitive silver chloride formed on the paper. After drying, the paper was put sensitive side up directly beneath a negative (an image in which the lightest areas of the photographed subject appear darkest and the darkest areas appear lightest) and under a sheet of glass in a printing frame. This paper-negative-glass sandwich was exposed, glass side up, outdoors in sunlight. The photographer determined the length of exposure, up to two hours, by visual inspection. When the print had reached the desired intensity, it was removed from the frame and fixed with sodium thiosulfate—at that time called hyposulfite of soda (“hypo”)—which stopped the chemical reactions. It was then thoroughly washed and dried."

msgid "[[☃ image 1]]The lifelike detail that daguerreotypes offered was well suited for portraiture, and the rich, black tones and mirror-like surface facilitated a sharp, positive image. Grayish-white tones were often modified with delicate application of color, heightening the image’s sense of realism. Refinements of technique and equipment considerably reduced exposure times and made the daguerreotype wildly popular until the middle of the 1850s, despite its relative expense."

msgid "[[☃ image 1]]The process of making daguerreotypes began with an extremely thorough cleaning and polishing of the silver-plated sheet. Next the shiny plate was suspended over iodine in a closed container. Rising vapors from the iodine would unite with the silver to produce a light-sensitive surface coating of silver iodide. The sensitized plate, inside a lightproof holder, was transferred to a camera and, in the earliest days, exposed to light for as long as twenty-five minutes. The plate was then developed by placing it in a container suspended over a heated dish of mercury, the vapor from which reacted with the exposed silver iodide to produce an image in an amalgam of silver mercury. The image was fixed (made permanent) by immersion in a solution of salt or hyposulfite of soda, and toned with gold chloride to improve its color, definition, and permanence. Information on Daguerre’s technique quickly spread from country to country. As the public became captivated by the sensation of seeing portraits that appeared more lifelike than painted or drawn images, daguerreotype studios soon sprung up across Europe and the United States."

msgid "Brothers William and Frederick Langenheim were among the entrepreneurs inspired by the development of the railroads in the United States. In the mid-19th century, they made a series of glass stereographs of train travel. A stereograph consists of two nearly identical photographs mounted onto a support of either glass or cardboard. When viewed together in a stereoscopic device, they produce a seemingly three-dimensional image. In those years the process required a great amount of time and labor, but the Langenheims produced many fine-quality images. Their stereograph of the Niagara Suspension Bridge (shown below) dates from 1855–56\\. It shows the newly built bridge with a locomotive crossing the Niagara River Gorge; the falls are faintly visible in the background. This small, hand-colored glass plate, an almost jewel-like object, requires transmitted light to illuminate the scene. When viewed in the stereoscope, the small image becomes powerfully immersive."

msgid "By 1839, fourteen years after the appearance of the first public passenger train, another significant technical innovation had appeared: photography. When the invention of photography was announced, it too was hailed as an invention that would revolutionize the world. However, most people were as unaware of the technical processes that allowed photographs to be made as they were of the inner workings of locomotion. Photography offered the public a way to record the physical world with remarkable clarity."

msgid "In 1830, the British actress Fanny Kemble described riding in a train as “strange beyond description.” This new mode of transportation started at almost exactly the same time as an equally revolutionary invention: photography. The two would radically change perceptions of time, space, and place in the world. Whether commissioned by railroad companies or made as independent works of art, photographs depict the strong connection between two 19th-century inventions that forever changed perception."

msgid "In the 19th century, the railroad was a new and exciting innovation, often documented in photographs that celebrated technological achievements and recorded novel or unfamiliar landscapes. The early 20th century, however, ushered in new approaches to the subject. Once people became familiar with train travel, photography was no longer required to inform people about the workings and appearance of the railroad. Many photographers began to record images of the railroad for aesthetic reasons alone. Artists responded to railroad machinery in a variety of ways, producing dramatic abstractions, detailed technical studies, or staged compositions that continued the tradition of showing trains in use."

msgid "Photography and the railways enjoyed a mutually beneficial partnership. Photography could reproduce a passenger’s perspective from safe inside the railcar, while also offering a more comprehensive account than any one passenger could experience. Photographs filled the gaps of the physical journey. But they also documented the progress of the railroad and its evolving technologies, providing a social history of one of the most important innovations of the 19th century. Photography provided evidence of the impact of iron rails on the physical world, while also revealing the artistic and intellectual influences of the photographer."

msgid "The steam locomotive shattered this pace. Traveling at up to three times the speed of a horse carriage, the early locomotives were able to cover great distances in much less time. The new form of transportation was faster, mechanized, and comparatively detached from nature. While the physical momentum of humans or animals was intuitively understood, steam locomotion was both new and mysterious. To describe steam power, people often made analogies between the new form of transportation and the old: Many early accounts refer to the steam engine as a living animal, an “iron horse.”"

msgid "[[☃ image 1]]Charles Sheeler’s 1939 photograph _Wheels_ (shown above) exemplifies this shift, with the cylinders, valve gear, and driving wheels of a locomotive as the focus of the image. Sheeler’s composition concentrates on the nuts and bolts that hold the locomotive together, while the steam escaping from the piston at the lower right suggests that this image is a fleeting one. At any moment, this massive machine may begin to roll out of view. Sheeler frames the picture so that the ghost-gray disk wheel is contrasted with the dark cylinder casing. This play of light and dark, together with the steam vapor, makes a forceful portrait of potential energy."

msgid "As some of these steps required darkness, photographers had to bring dark tents or wagons as well as chemicals and glass plates into the field with them. When enough detail became visible in the negative in the weak light of a darkroom, the negative was removed from the developer. It was then washed in water, fixed with a solution of sodium thiosulfate to remove excess undeveloped silver iodide, thoroughly washed to remove the sodium thiosulfate, and dried. With the addition of a protective coat of varnish, the negative was ready to be used to make prints."

msgid "In the 19th century, the collodion used to coat glass plates was made from gun cotton, a commercially available product, which was ordinary cotton that had been soaked in nitric and sulfuric acid, and then dried. The photographer next dissolved the gun cotton in a mixture of alcohol and ether to which potassium iodide had been added. The resultant collodion was a syrupy mixture that could be easily poured onto clean glass plates as the first step in the production of negatives."

msgid "In the wet collodion process, collodion was poured from a beaker with one hand onto a perfectly cleaned glass plate, which was continuously and steadily tilted with the other hand to quickly distribute an even coating. The plate was of whatever size the finished print was to be, from a quarter plate measuring 4 by 5 inches to a mammoth plate measuring 18 by 21 inches. When the collodion had set but not dried (in a matter of seconds), the plate was sensitized by bathing it in a solution of silver nitrate, which combined with the potassium iodide in the collodion to produce light-sensitive silver iodide. After being placed in a holder, the plate was then placed in a camera for exposure while still wet—hence, the identification of the process as “wet.” After exposure, the plate was immediately developed in a solution of pyrogallic and acetic acids; a later refinement of the process used ferrous sulfate as a developer."

msgid "The wet collodion process was a photographic process used to produce a negative. It was invented by F. Scott Archer (1813–1857) in 1848 and published in 1851\\. Prevalent from 1855 to about 1881, it gradually displaced both the daguerreotype and calotype processes (a process involving both a negative and a positive, introduced by William Henry Fox Talbot in 1841). Wet-collodion-on-glass negatives were valued because the transparency of the glass produced a high resolution of detail in both the highlights and shadows of the resultant prints (see image below). In addition, exposure times were shorter than those for the daguerreotype or calotype, ranging from a few seconds to a few minutes, depending on the amount of light available. Finished negatives were usually used to produce albumen prints, although salt prints were sometimes made during the 1850s and early 1860s."

msgid "The second and most dangerous phase of production in the direct lost-wax method is casting the bronze. This process is completed in a **foundry**, which is a facility for pouring and casting hot metals. The first step of phase two is depicted below, where the investment is turned upside down and set inside a kiln to be heated. When heated, the thin wax layer and sprues melt away to create voids in the mold into which the molten bronze will be cast. The core pins act as braces, holding the core in place once the wax is melted away. The investment is then buried right side up to ensure safety during the pouring process."

msgid "Using Adriaen de Vries’s stunning 17th-century sculpture _Juggling Man_ as an example, this article examines the laborious process of creating a bronze sculpture with the **direct lost-wax method**. This technique, used since antiquity, involves preparing a wax model over a clay and metal core, and ultimately replacing the wax with bronze to create the finished artwork. One reason De Vries chose to cast the _Juggling Man_ and many of his other sculptures using the direct lost-wax method is because this procedure produces one unique bronze cast of an original sculpture. The term **casting** refers to the process of pouring liquid hot metal into a hollow three-dimensional form, also known as a **mold**, and allowing that metal to harden before removing it from the mold."

She made many life-size wooden sculptures like _Saint Ginés de la Jara_ while serving under King Charles II. After his death in 1700, La Roldana served King Phillip V (1683–1746) until her passing in 1706\\.

msgid "It was typical throughout 17th-century Europe for artists to work collaboratively in workshops, and there were many well-known printmaking, weaving, painting, and sculpting studios. Among them was the workshop of Pedro Roldán (1624–1699), who was revered as one of the greatest sculptors in Seville, Spain, during his time. He employed his children as well as other apprentices, and all of them were trained in every aspect of art making, including drawing, painting, and sculpting. Six of Pedro Roldán’s eleven children went on to become successful painters and sculptors in their own right. His daughter, Luisa Roldán, was among them. She lived and worked for most of her life in Seville, which is located in Andalusia, a southern region of Spain."

msgid "[[☃ image 1]]In the skillfully rendered Roman portrait shown above, the smooth oval face mimics idealized Greek sculpture, and the hair and diadem recall images of Greek goddesses. The protruding ears and slightly receding chin, however, imply the individual face of a real woman."

msgid "[[☃ image 1]]Rodin titled this piece _Christ and Mary Magdalene_, but he also called it _The Genius and Pity_ (_Pity_ being a personification, in classical style, of an emotion) and _Prometheus and the Oceanid_, a reference to the Greek myth in which the Titan Prometheus was chained to a rock by Zeus for giving man fire. Rodin, with both his nude figures and his titles, infused the composition with classical mythological and aesthetic themes as enduring as the marble that embodies them."

msgid "[[☃ image 1]]The 18th-century statue of Venus adjusting her sandal, shown above right, was inspired by another statue type of the goddess in classical art. Like ancient sculptors, Joseph Nollekens chose to depict Venus nude to emphasize her beauty and allure. Carved fully in the round in a satiny white marble, the figure was designed to be viewed from multiple angles."

msgid "[[☃ image 1]]The _Lansdowne Herakles_, shown above, very likely was a Roman copy inspired by a lost Greek statue from the 300s B.C. Found near the ruins of the villa of the Roman emperor Hadrian at Tivoli outside Rome, the _Lansdowne Herakles_ was probably one of numerous copies of Greek sculpture commissioned by Hadrian, who loved Greek culture. The statue was named for Lord Lansdowne, who once owned the Herakles and displayed it in his home in London."

msgid "[[☃ image 1]]The fine details of the elaborate hairstyle and costly jewelry and dress display the artist’s true mastery of marble carving. Algardi sculpted the delicate lace mantle in low relief with subtle contours that reveal how the garment fell around the sitter's shoulders. The strand of pearls, which weaves across her chest and around her sash, is carved in extremely high relief and in some places entirely in the round."
