msgid "**West Africa** stretches from modern-day Mauritania to the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It encompasses lush rainforests along the equator, savannas on either side of the forest, and much drier land to the north. Until about 600 CE, most Africans living in this area were hunter-gatherers. In the driest areas, herders maintained sheep, goats, cattle, or camels. In the more heavily wooded area near the equator, farmers raised yams, palm products, or plantains. The savanna areas yielded crops including rice, millet, and sorghum."

Famine or fear of stronger enemies might force one tribe to ask another for help and give themselves in bondage in exchange for assistance. Similar to the [European serf system](/humanities/us-history/precontact-and-early-colonial-era/before-contact/a/pre-colonization-european-society), those seeking protection or relief from starvation would become the servants of those who provided relief. Debt might also be worked off through some form of servitude. Furthermore, prisoners of war between different African societies oftentimes became enslaved. "

msgid "Although the Portuguese originally used the fort for trading gold, by the 16th century they had shifted their focus to trading enslaved people, as the demand for slave labor ballooned in the New World. The dungeon of the fort morphed to served as a holding pen for Africans from the interior of the continent. On the upper floors, Portuguese traders ate, slept, and prayed. Enslaved people lived in the dungeon for weeks or months until ships arrived to transport them to Europe or the Americas. For them, the dungeon of Elmina was their last sight of their home continent.

msgid "Although there were large trading centers along the rivers—the Senegal, Gambia, Niger, Volta, and Congo—most West Africans lived in small villages and identified primarily with their extended family or clan, rather than an ethnic or national identity. Wives, children, and dependents were a sign of wealth; men frequently practiced **polygyny**, or the custom of having more than one wife. In times of need, West Africans relied on relatives from near and far for support. Hundreds of separate dialects emerged from different west African clans; in modern Nigeria, nearly 500 languages are still spoken."

Originally built as a fortified trading post, the castle had mounted cannons facing out to sea, not inland toward continental Africa. The Portuguese had greater fear of a naval attack from other Europeans than of a land attack from Africans."

msgid "The first major empire to emerge in West Africa was the **Ghana Empire**. By 750, the Soninke farmers of the region had become wealthy by taxing traders who traversed their area. For instance, the Niger River basin supplied gold to the Berber and Arab traders from west of the Nile Valley, who brought cloth, weapons, and manufactured goods into the African interior. Since Ghana’s king controlled the **gold supply**, he was able to maintain price controls and afford a strong military."

msgid "As the Northeast became more agricultural, paradoxically, the region became more urbanized. Although we consider agricultural areas less densely populated today, the farming industry required people to begin to live together and create more fortified villages to protect their harvests. They lived in **longhouses** that would extend up to one hundred feet. Since Algonquians farmed while also maintaining hunting and fishing, they “commuted” from less permanent villages of wigwams. But as certain tribes, like the Iroquois, began having immense farming and thereby trading success, **intertribal violence** intensified. "

In hopes of ending intertribal conflict in upstate New York, the Mohawks, Oneidas, Onondagas, Cayugas, and Senecas established the Iroquois League, or the **Great League of Peace**. Historians disagree about when the League was established, most likely between 1100 and 1400 AD. During this time period, the Iroquoian Indians met for about a year to devise a solution to this cyclic pattern of violence and retribution between tribes. "

All throughout the Ohio River Valley, Native Americans built mounds in the earth where they would bury their deceased. Other archaeologists argue that they were intended for ceremonial purposes. Either way, large mounds and animal-shaped earthworks still exist  throughout this area today."

If they were close to a river and therefore a supply of fish, groups would not rely on their village as much, and live in smaller bands. However, most lived in villages close to their crops. In agricultural Hopewellian societies, men  planted and harvested, while women worked in the home, took care of the children, and processed the crops. "

msgid "The Hopewellian period in the Eastern Woodland region spread over the cultural shift from hunting and gathering to budding agricultural systems. Some historians estimate that Native Americans were farming squash in Illinois as early as 5000 BCE. Corn farming spread through trading networks to the Ohio River Valley from the Southwest by 350 BCE. Native peoples tended to their crops carefully and religiously. They soon also began to plant and grow beans. Together, the corn, squash, and beans, became known as the sacred \"**three sisters**,” a term coined by the Iroquois people. According to the Iroquois, the three crops would only thrive if planted close together."

The Northeastern landscape is dominated by the Appalachian Mountains, which include rolling hills and prominent peaks. Native Americans settled extensively in this area, especially during the **Hopewellian period** from 200 BCE to 500 CE, primarily due to the temperate climate, accessible waterways, and good farming conditions. The tribes most notably connected to this area include the Algonquians, Iroquois, Susquehannocks, Mohicans, and Hurons, among others."

msgid "As the Plains Indians became more focused on hunting, they became more nomadic. This is not to say that all Plains Indians were nomadic or they had no societal structure—in fact, their societies were well organized and mission-aligned, just mobile. The **teepee**—a conical tent made out of a buffalo skin and wood—was easy to put up and take down if a band was following a buffalo herd for hunting. Sometimes, Plains Indians lived in a combination of nomadic and sedentary settings: they would plant crops and establish villages in the spring, hunt in the summer, harvest their crops in the fall, and hunt in the winter."

They made **bull boats** by stretching bison skin over a wooden frame to trade goods along the rivers. They traded elaborate baskets and leather for metal and furs from the Northeast."

msgid "It is a common misconception that all Native Americans hunted buffalo, atop horses, wearing elaborate headdresses. In practice, Plains American Indians hunted large animals early as the 12,000 BCE. Before the arrival of horses with the Spanish in the 16th century, Plains Indians practiced a mixture of agriculture and hunting on foot, using large spears with [**Clovis points**](humanities/art-history/art-americas/early-cultures/clovis-culture/a/clovis-culture) at the end. Clovis points, sharp points carved out of stone, have been now discovered all across the United States. Archaeologists estimate that a spear with a Clovis point at the end could kill animals the size of African elephants, corroborating the idea that Native Americans used these two centimeter spearpoints to hunt massive animals, like **mammoths, buffalo, and bison**."

msgid "Plains Native Americans planted the three sisters—beans, squash, and corn—as they arrived from the Southwest around 900 CE. Agriculture was most commonly practiced and most fruitful along the rivers. Also, Plains Indians first harvested plants for medicinal purposes; for example, chokecherries were thought to cure stomach sickness. Women farmed and gathered, while many men continued to hunt. Hunting became a more dominant practice when a drought struck in the 1300s. "

Rituals often revolved around the sun and nature, regarding the Earth as the mother of all spirits. Cheyennes, for example, performed the **Sun Dance**, which forced people to sacrifice something personal for communal benefit. Lakotas believed that certain individuals were blessed to be spiritual leaders or medicine men. Plains Indians regarded the buffalo and their migration patterns as sacred. "

msgid "The Plains region spreads to the east of the Rocky Mountains, up to 400 miles across the flat land of the center of the present-day United States. It covers parts of ten central states, including Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Minnesota, Wyoming, Nebraska, Colorado, Kansas, Oklahoma, New Mexico, and Texas. The Plains were very sparsely populated until about 1100 CE, when Native American groups including Pawnees, Mandans, Omahas, Wichitas, Cheyennes and other groups started to inhabit  the area. The climate supported limited farming closer to the major waterways, but ultimately became most fruitful for hunting large and small game."

A band could consist of  a dozen to a few hundred people who lived together, hunted together, and travelled together. Oftentimes, bands would unite in a village setting to farm or hunt a large group of bison. Villages usually had quite fluid populations and little to no political structure. Pawnees, however, were comprised of 19 autonomous villages who united politically.  "

msgid "With the introduction of horses, Plains Indian societies became less **egalitarian**; men with the most horses had the most political impact, social status, and economic power. As European  colonists arrived, the Sioux, in particular, began to trade with them. They received guns and horses by giving the Spanish, French, and Dutch buffalo robes, blankets and beads. Resources were no longer shared, but a means with which to compete and distinguish one’s tribe. **Intertribal conflict** increased due to this heightened competition. Tribes would steal other tribes’ horses in order for economic gain and glory. This began a pattern of violence between the Native American groups and Euro-American  colonists as they encroached across the Plains during the centuries to come."

The sacraments, or special ceremonies of the Church, marked every stage of life, from birth to marriage to burial. As Christianity spread throughout Europe, it replaced pagan and animistic views, explaining supernatural events and forces of nature in its own terms. God in heaven, creator of the universe and beyond the realm of nature and the known, controlled all events, warring against the force of darkness, known as the Devil or Satan, here on earth."

Penitents confessed to the priest, who absolved them and assigned them penance to atone for their acts and save themselves from eternal damnation.

msgid "Europe’s feudal society was a **mutually supportive** system, at least in theory. The lords owned the land; the knights gave military service to a lord and carried out his justice; the serfs worked the land in return for the protection from invaders within the walls of the lord’s castle or city. Feudal society was first based on communal farming, but as lords became more powerful, they privatized their ownership and rented land to their subjects. Thus, although they were technically free, serfs were effectively bound to the land they worked, which supported them and their families, as well as the lord and all who depended on him. In practice, serfdom looked more like slavery than employment."

Without a dominant centralized power or overarching cultural hub, Europe experienced political and military discord. Social and economic devastation arrived in the 1340s when Genoese merchants returning from the Black Sea unwittingly brought with them a rat-borne and highly contagious disease: the bubonic plague. In a few short years, it had killed about one-third of Europe’s population. The effects of the devastating disease are known as the **Black Death**. "

msgid "Ultimately, the pope decided all matters of theology, interpreting the will of God to the people, but he also had authority over temporal matters. Because the Church had the ability to **excommunicate** people, or send a soul to hell forever, even monarchs feared to challenge its power. It was also the seat of all knowledge. Latin, the language of the Church, served as a unifying factor for a continent of isolated regions, each with its own dialect. The mostly illiterate serfs were thus dependent on those literate priests to read and interpret the Bible, the word of God, for them. The feudal system, therefore, relied on the sanctity and fervor of religion to keep serfs tied to their lord."

msgid "Mississippian culture continued the mound-building traditions of the Hopewellian people and extended them into the plains and southward. Mississippian **mound societies** were larger and more complex than previous communities, indicating unprecedented population growth and wealth. **Cahokia**, near modern day St. Louis, was home to an estimated 40,000 Cahokian people, after whom the city was named. It became the major urban trade center along the Mississippi River and remained the largest city in North America until Philadelphia surpassed it over 500 years later, in the mid-eighteenthth century. Monk’s Mound, at the center of Cahokia, is the largest pre-Columbian earthwork in modern America, expanding 955 feet in length and 100 feet in height. Cahokia declined sharply around 1250, probably due to environmental factors like overhunting or deforestation."

msgid "Historians  credit the Anasazi, Mogollon, and Hohokam as the first farmers in  America. **Corn**, the first crop the Ancestral Pueblos cultivated, permeates many creation stories of the Pueblo people. The Ancestral Pueblos regarded the harvest of corn not only as a nutritional necessity, but a spiritual gift. Although agriculture seemed to represent the society’s development, the Ancestral Pueblos had a much healthier diet when they hunted and gathered, as opposed to the limited diversity in a diet dominated by corn."

In 800 CE, the Hohokam had created one of the largest **irrigation systems** to date, stretching through most of what we call Arizona today. This new irrigation system allowed the Pueblos to begin planting beans and squash, in addition to corn."

In this region dwelled several groups we collectively call the Pueblo.

Since the Pueblos did less hunting, men helped with farming. In addition to farm labor, women raised children and performed household tasks, while male heads of households would participate in an informal council to make community, or **band**, decisions. Band leaders generally had more impact on decision making and public relations than the tribe, a more loosely configured political organization. While the band would deal with public happenings and unrest, the **tribe** provided an ethnic identity for the regional people. "

msgid "In less densely populated areas, sociopolitical organization and tribal relationships were constantly evolving. People generally identified with family-based bands called **tribelets**. A tribelet would include a few hundred to a thousand people that aligned culturally, but hunted and gathered in smaller units of 10-12 people. In areas with sparse natural resources, native groups were more nomadic and less connected to other groups. "

Others, in resource-rich areas mostly in the Pacific Northwest, lived in more permanent and established villages. The structure of shelter oftentimes indicated the sustainability of the food source—the more plentiful the fish and acorns in the area, the more likely the native peoples lived in intricately-designed homes within societies that were there to stay."

Along the Colorado River, Native Americans gathered a variety of wild food and planted some tobacco. **Acorns** were a pivotal part of the Californian diet. Women would gather and process the acorns. They removed toxins from the pulp inside the nut and made it into flour, creating a less perishable source of nourishment. In the Pacific Northwest, people foraged for pine nuts, wild plants, and more. "

msgid "The West of United States, extending from the top corner of Washington, through California and into parts of Nevada, Utah, Colorado, and Idaho, was home to a diverse array of Native American groups living off bountiful **natural resources** much before Lewis and Clark ever discovered the region’s riches. It is hard to generalize about the cultural practices of native groups in the West since the climate and resources  varied immensely, creating microenvironments which different groups  used to advantage. Some tribes that lived in the Pacific Northwest include the Makah and the Kwakiutl people. Over one hundred federally-recognized tribes lived in modern California. The Great Basin—the vast expanse of land between the Rocky Mountains and the Sierra Nevadas—was home to the Mono, Paiute, Bannock, Shoshone, Ute, and Gosiute peoples, among others."

Early botanists included the English naturalist **Sir Hans Sloane**, who traveled to Jamaica in 1687 and there recorded hundreds of new plants. "

msgid "Perhaps the single greatest impact of European colonization on the North American environment was the introduction of disease. **Microbes** to which native inhabitants had no immunity caused sickness and death everywhere Europeans settled. Along the New England coast between 1616 and 1618, epidemics claimed the lives of 75 percent of the native people. In the 1630s, half of the Huron and Iroquois people  living near  the Great Lakes died of **smallpox**. The very young and the very old were the most vulnerable and had the highest mortality rates. The loss of the older generation meant the loss of knowledge and tradition, while the death of children only compounded the trauma."

msgid "The European presence in America spurred countless changes in the environment, negatively affecting native animals as well as people. The popularity of beaver-trimmed hats in Europe, coupled with Indians’ desire for European weapons, led to the **overhunting** of beavers in the Northeast. Soon, beavers were extinct in New England, New York, and other areas. With their loss came the loss of beaver ponds, which had served as habitats for fish as well as water sources for deer, moose, and other animals. Furthermore, Europeans introduced **pigs**, which they allowed to forage in forests and other wildlands. Pigs consumed the foods on which deer and other indigenous species depended, resulting in scarcity of the game native peoples had traditionally hunted. "

The lure of profit pushed explorers to seek new trade routes to the Spice Islands and to eliminate Muslim middlemen. Upon learning from cutting-edge scholars that the world was round and that they could reach the East by going westward, different European powers began to compile plans, funds, and ships in order to find a new route to Asia."

Portuguese sailors successfully navigated an eastward route to West Africa, where they established a trading foothold. Portugal then spread its empire down the western coast of Africa to the Congo, along the western coast of India, and eventually to Brazil and the Atlantic islands. While the Portuguese did not rule over an immense landmass, their strategic holdings of islands and coastal ports gave them almost unrivaled control of nautical trade routes."

msgid "The Crusades provided the religious ideology for the **Reconquista**, which in turn inspired Atlantic colonization. The Reconquista, or reconquest, refers to the 800 years of violence and expulsion of Muslims from the Iberian Peninsula after the failed Crusades. The Crusades and the Reconquista cemented **religious intolerance**, and the Christians looked to colonization partly as a means of continuing religious conquests. Particularly in the strongly Catholic nations of Spain and Portugal, religious zeal motivated the rulers to convert Native Americans and sanctify Christian global dominance."

msgid "The travels of Portuguese traders to western Africa also acquainted the Portuguese with the African slave trade, already widely in practice in West Africa and funded by **sugar production** on the newly colonized Atlantic islands. Upon discovering the immense global market for sugar, the Portuguese began to trade enslaved people across the Atlantic to toil on the sugar plantations. The Portuguese fort **Elmina Castle**, located in modern-day Ghana, became more of a holding pen for enslaved Africans from the interior of the continent than a trading post, as the markets for slave labor in both Europe and then the New World boomed."

Before the arrival of the Spanish, for example, the Inca people of the Andes consumed chicha, a corn beer, for ritual purposes only.

msgid "As Europeans expanded their market reach into the colonial sphere, they devised a new economic policy to ensure the colonies’ profitability. The philosophy of *mercantilism* shaped European perceptions of wealth from the 1500s to the late 1700s. Mercantilism held that only a limited amount of wealth, as measured in gold and silver bullion, existed in the world. In order to gain power, nations had to amass wealth by mining these precious raw materials from their colonial possessions. Mercantilists did not believe in free trade, arguing instead that the nation should control trade to create wealth and to enhance state power. In this view, colonies existed to strengthen the colonizing nation."

msgid "Of all the commodities in the Atlantic World, sugar proved to be the most important. Indeed, in the colonial era, sugar carried the same economic importance as oil does today. European rivals raced to create sugar plantations in the Americas and fought wars for control of production. Although refined sugar was available in the Old World, Europe’s harsher climate made sugarcane difficult to grow. Columbus brought sugar to Hispaniola in 1493, and the new crop thrived. Over the next century of colonization, Caribbean islands and most other tropical areas became centers of sugar production, which in turn fueled the demand to enslave Africans for labor."

Many Native Americans used horses to transform their hunting and gathering into a highly mobile practice. "

msgid "Though of secondary importance to sugar, tobacco also had great value for Europeans as a **cash crop**—a crop cultivated for sale instead of personal consumption. Native Americans had been growing tobacco for medicinal and ritual purposes for centuries before European contact, believing tobacco could improve concentration and enhance wisdom. To some, its use meant achieving an entranced, altered, or divine state."

msgid "Tobacco was unknown in Europe before 1492, and it carried a negative stigma at first. The early Spanish explorers considered native people's use of tobacco to be proof of their savagery. However, European colonists then took up the habit of smoking, and they brought it across the Atlantic. Europeans ascribed medicinal properties to tobacco, claiming that it could cure headaches and skin irritations. Even so, Europeans did not import tobacco in great quantities until the 1590s. At that time, it became the first truly **global commodity**; English, French, Dutch, Spanish, and Portuguese colonists all grew it for the world market. "

During the winter of 1540–41, the explorers waged war against the **Tiwa** people in present-day New Mexico. Rather than leading to the discovery of gold and silver, however, the expedition simply left Coronado bankrupt."

Although his first efforts against the Inca Empire in the 1520s failed, Pizarro captured the Inca emperor Atahualpa in 1532 and executed him soon thereafter. In 1533, Pizarro founded Lima, Peru. Like Cortés, Pizarro had to combat not only the native peoples of the lands he was conquering but also competitors from his own country—a Spanish rival, Diego de Almagro, assassinated him in 1541. "

Their son, Martín, may have been the first **mestizo**—person of mixed indigenous American and European descent.

Hoping to salvage Portugal’s holdings, King João II negotiated a treaty with Spain. The **Treaty of Tordesillas** in 1494 drew a north-to-south line through South America. Spain gained territory west of the line, while Portugal retained the lands east of the line, including the east coast of Brazil."

msgid "One of this period’s most famous works is the novel ***The Ingenious Gentleman Don Quixote of La Mancha***, by Miguel de Cervantes. This two-volume book—1605 and 1618—told a colorful tale of a *hidalgo*, or gentleman, who reads so many tales of chivalry and knighthood that he becomes unable to tell reality from fiction. With his faithful sidekick Sancho Panza, Don Quixote leaves reality behind and sets out to revive chivalry by doing battle with what he perceives as the enemies of Spain. "

Charles I ascended the English throne in 1625 and soon married a French Catholic princess, Henrietta Maria, who was not well liked by English Protestants because she openly practiced Catholicism during her husband’s reign. The most outspoken Protestants, the **Puritans**, had a strong voice in Parliament in the 1620s, and they strongly opposed the king’s marriage and his ties to Catholicism. When Parliament tried to contest his edicts, including the king’s efforts to impose taxes without Parliament’s consent, Charles I suspended Parliament in 1629 and ruled without one for the next 11 years."

After years of fighting, the Parliamentary forces gained the upper hand, and in 1649, they charged Charles I with treason and beheaded him. The monarchy was dissolved, and England became a republic: a state without a king. Oliver Cromwell headed the new English Commonwealth, and the period known as the **English interregnum**, or the time between kings, began."

msgid "In Northampton, Massachusetts, **Jonathan Edwards** led still another explosion of evangelical fervor. Edwards’s best-known sermon, “Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God”, used powerful imagery to describe the terrors of hell and the possibilities of avoiding damnation by personal conversion. One passage reads: “The wrath of God burns against them [sinners], their damnation don’t slumber, the pit is prepared, the fire is made ready, the furnace is now hot, ready to receive them, the flames do now rage and glow. The glittering sword is whet, and held over them, and the pit hath opened her mouth under them.” Edwards’s revival spread along the Connecticut River Valley, and news of the event spread rapidly through the frequent reprinting of his famous sermon."

Tennant helped to spark a Presbyterian revival in the Middle Colonies—Pennsylvania, New York, and New Jersey—in part by founding a seminary to train other evangelical clergyman. New Lights also founded colleges in Rhode Island and New Hampshire that would later become Brown University and Dartmouth College."

These new churches gained converts and competed with older Protestant groups like Anglicans, members of the Church of England; Congregationalists, the heirs of Puritanism in America; and Quakers. The influence of these older Protestant groups, such as the New England Congregationalists, declined because of the Great Awakening. Nonetheless, the Great Awakening touched the lives of thousands on both sides of the Atlantic and provided a shared experience in the 18th-century British Empire."

One of the Indians carried my poor wounded babe upon a horse; it went moaning all along, “I shall die, I shall die.” I went on foot after it, with sorrow that cannot be expressed. At length I took it off the horse, and carried it in my arms till my strength failed, and I fell down with it. Then they set me upon a horse with my wounded child in my lap, and there being no furniture upon the horse’s back, as we were going down a steep hill we both fell over the horse’s head, at which they, like inhumane creatures, laughed, and rejoiced to see it, though I thought we should there have ended our days, as overcome with so many difficulties. But the Lord renewed my strength still, and carried me along, that I might see more of His power; yea, so much that I could never have thought of, had I not experienced it.\""

In particular, she held that Puritan ministers in New England taught a shallow version of Protestantism emphasizing hierarchy and actions—a “covenant of works” rather than a “covenant of grace.” Literate Puritan women like Hutchinson presented a challenge to the male ministers’ authority. Indeed, her major offense was her claim of direct religious revelation (that she spoke directly with God), a type of spiritual experience that negated the role of ministers. "

In keeping with the Protestant emphasis on reading scripture, he translated the Bible into the local Algonquian language and published his work in 1663.

msgid "When the Puritans began to arrive in the 1620s and 1630s, local Algonquian peoples viewed them as potential allies in the conflicts already simmering between rival native groups. In 1621, the Wampanoag, led by Massasoit, concluded a peace treaty with the Pilgrims at Plymouth. In the 1630s, the Puritans in Massachusetts and Plymouth allied themselves with the Narragansett and Mohegan people against the Pequot, who had recently expanded their claims into southern New England. In May 1637, the Puritans attacked a large group of several hundred Pequot along the Mystic River in Connecticut. To the horror of their Native American allies, the Puritans massacred all but a handful of the men, women, and children they found."

msgid "Indeed, the Bible itself became part of the struggle between Puritans and **James I**, who as King of England was head of the Church of England. Soon after ascending the throne, James commissioned a new version of the Bible in an effort to stifle Puritan reliance on the Geneva Bible, which followed the teachings of John Calvin and placed God’s authority above the monarch’s. The King James Version, published in 1611, instead emphasized the majesty of kings."

These reformers, who followed the teachings of [John Calvin](/humanities/world-history/renaissance-and-reformation/protestant-reformation/v/introduction-to-the-protestant-reformation-3-of-4) and other Protestant reformers, were called Puritans because of their insistence on purifying the Church of England of what they believed to be unscriptural, Catholic elements that lingered in its institutions and practices."

msgid "Born in Boston in 1706 to a large Puritan family, Franklin loved to read, although he found little beyond religious publications in his father’s house. In 1718 he was apprenticed to his brother to work in a print shop, where he learned how to be a good writer by copying the style he found in the *Spectator*, which his brother printed. At the age of 17, the independent-minded Franklin ran away, eventually ending up in Quaker Philadelphia. There he began publishing the *Pennsylvania Gazette* in the late 1720s. In 1732 he started his annual publication *Poor Richard: An Almanack*, in which he gave readers much practical advice, such as “Early to bed, early to rise, makes a man healthy, wealthy, and wise.”"

Deists also advanced the belief that personal morality—an individual’s moral compass, leading to good works and actions—is more important than strict church doctrines. Franklin’s deism guided his many philanthropic projects. In 1731, he established a reading library that became the Library Company of Philadelphia. In 1743, he founded the American Philosophical Society to encourage the spirit of inquiry. In 1749, he provided the foundation for the University of Pennsylvania, and in 1751, he helped found Pennsylvania Hospital."

msgid "His career as a printer made Franklin wealthy and well-respected. When he retired in 1748, he devoted himself to politics and scientific experiments. His most famous work, on electricity, exemplified Enlightenment principles. Franklin observed that lightning strikes tended to hit metal objects and reasoned that he could therefore direct lightning through the placement of metal objects during an electrical storm. He used this knowledge to advocate the use of lightning rods: metal poles connected to wires directing lightning’s electrical charge into the ground, thus saving wooden homes in cities like Philadelphia from catastrophic fires. He published his findings in 1751 in *Experiments and Observations on Electricity*."

msgid "Although their overall economic impact was minimal, the Navigation Acts imposed burdens on those segments of American colonial society best positioned to foment a rebellion. The groups most negatively affected by the Navigation Acts—colonial manufacturers and merchants; tobacco, rice, and sugar planters; and artisans and mechanics—were all central actors in prerevolutionary anti-British agitation. Merchants were especially active in colonial politics, and they responded to the acts with hostility. The passage of the Navigation Acts thus contributed to rising anti-British sentiment and the eventual outbreak of the American Revolution.$^4$  "

msgid "**Queen Elizabeth** favored England’s advance into the Atlantic World, though her main concern was blocking Spain’s effort to eliminate Protestantism. Indeed, England could not commit to large-scale colonization in the Americas as long as Spain appeared ready to invade Ireland or Scotland. Elizabeth did, however, approve of English **privateers**, sea captains to whom the home government had given permission to raid the enemy at will. These skilled mariners cruised the Caribbean, plundering Spanish ships whenever they could. Each year the English took more than £100,000 from Spain in this way; English privateer **Francis Drake** first made a name for himself when, in 1573, he looted silver, gold, and pearls worth £40,000."

However, in the 1500s, England devoted its colonizing resources to Ireland."

More important, England lacked the financial resources for such endeavors. Nonetheless, English monarchs carefully monitored developments in the new Atlantic World and took steps to assert England’s claim to the Americas. "

msgid "Elizabeth sanctioned one early attempt at colonization in 1584, when **Sir Walter Raleigh**, a favorite of the queen’s, attempted to establish a colony at **Roanoke**, an island off the coast of present-day North Carolina. The colony was small, consisting of only 117 people, who suffered a poor relationship with the local native people, the Croatans, and struggled to survive in their new land. Their governor, John White, returned to England in late 1587 to secure more people and supplies, but events conspired to keep him away from Roanoke for three years. By the time he returned in 1590, the entire colony had vanished. The only trace the colonists left behind was the word Croatoan carved into a fence surrounding the village. Governor White never knew whether the colonists had decamped for nearby Croatoan Island—now Hatteras—or whether some disaster had befallen them all. Roanoke is still called the Lost Colony."

msgid "English promoters of colonization pushed its commercial advantages and the religious justification that English colonies would allow the establishment of Protestantism in the Americas. Both arguments struck a chord. In the early 1600s, wealthy English merchants and the landed elite began to pool their resources to form **joint stock companies**. In this novel business arrangement, which was in many ways the precursor to the modern corporation, investors provided the capital for and assumed the risk of a venture in order to reap significant returns. The companies gained the approval of the English crown to establish colonies, and their investors dreamed of reaping great profits from the money they put into overseas colonization."

The English colonies also differed from each other; Barbados and Virginia had a decidedly commercial orientation from the start, while the Puritan colonies of New England were intensely religious at their inception. All English settlements in the Americas, however, marked the increasingly important role of England in the Atlantic World."

He was wounded in battle and never got paid for his military service. When in 1780 he returned home to Brookfield, a rural area west of Boston, he found that he was being taken to court for debts that went unpaid while he was off fighting the war. Since he had not been compensated for his service, he had no way of paying these debts. "

msgid "On April 18, Revere was warned that British Army regulars were making their way to the towns of Lexington and Concord. Having already warned the militia in Concord, which had secured the weapons supply, Revere rode quickly to **Lexington** to warn the townspeople of the expected British onslaught. The rebel intelligence network suggested that the British aim in Lexington was to capture Samuel Adams and John Hancock, two of the most prominent Patriot leaders, but the size of the British army force was large enough to suggest they had bigger goals in mind."

In September 1830, Choctaws became the first tribe to sign a treaty and voluntarily relocate to the territory that would become the state of Arkansas. Seminoles refused to leave their ancestral lands in Florida, sparking the Second Seminole War in 1835. Seminole chief Osceola led the resistance, which proved costly to the United States in terms of both money and casualties.

msgid "After the [War of 1812](/humanities/us-history/the-early-republic/politics-society-early-19th-c/a/the-war-of-1812), a series of tariffs—taxes on imported goods—was enacted. The purpose of these tariffs was to protect American manufacturing from low-priced British manufactured goods. Because the domestic manufacturing industry was still in its infancy, it could not compete with the low prices of British manufactures. The first protective tariff was passed in 1816, followed by an increase in tariff rates in 1824. In 1828, during the presidency of [John Quincy Adams](/humanities/us-history/the-early-republic/politics-society-early-19th-c/a/the-presidency-of-john-quincy-adams), Congress passed legislation that included an even higher tariff designed to shelter the burgeoning American manufacturing industry from British competition.$^1$ "

Former president [John Quincy Adams](/humanities/us-history/the-early-republic/politics-society-early-19th-c/a/the-presidency-of-john-quincy-adams) was one of the leading voices opposing Calhoun and nullification. He argued that it was the Supreme Court, not the states, that had the ultimate authority to declare federal legislation unconstitutional. And although Jackson was sympathetic to Southerners who complained that protective tariffs damaged their interests, he refused to countenance threats of nullification. Jackson supported states’ rights but viewed nullification as a prelude to secession, and he vehemently opposed any measure that could potentially break up the Union. In July 1832, in an effort to compromise, he signed a new tariff bill that lowered most import duties to their 1816 levels. "

Calhoun authored a pamphlet titled “South Carolina Exposition and Protest,” which was published anonymously and put forward the theory of **nullification**—the declaration of a federal law as null and void within state borders. He argued that since the authority of the federal government derived from the consent of the states, states could nullify any federal law they considered unconstitutional. Calhoun contended that the US Constitution authorized tariffs only for the purpose of raising revenue and not for the purpose of discouraging foreign competition. The theory of nullification, in maintaining that South Carolina could refuse to enforce a federal law, ushered in a constitutional crisis.$^4$"

Jackson became embroiled in a political battle with **Nicholas Biddle**, the president of the Second Bank of the United States. Although the US Supreme Court had declared the bank constitutional and had renewed its charter until 1836, after Jackson was reelected in 1832, he made it his personal mission to shut the bank down.

At the tender age of 13, he was captured by the British and suffered both a head injury that left him permanently scarred and an outbreak of smallpox. "

The dominant campaign issue was continental expansion, particularly the acquisition of Oregon country and the annexation of Texas. Polk was a strong proponent of both, while Clay was ambivalent. Reflecting popular enthusiasm for the ideology of [Manifest Destiny](/humanities/us-history/early-republic/a/manifest-destiny), which held that white European-Americans were destined by God to settle the North American continent, Polk won with 50 percent of the popular vote and 170 electoral votes.$^1$"

msgid "Though it may seem that Polk achieved all of his goals as president, his embrace of Manifest Destiny and the acquisition of new territories inflamed tensions between abolitionists and slaveholders and heightened conflict between white settlers and Native Americans.$^3$ While the North and South fought over whether the new states admitted to the Union were to be free states or slave states, the battles between the Plains Indians and settlers in Texas grew particularly vicious. Though Comanches put up an especially fierce resistance to the encroachment of white people onto their lands, they were ultimately vanquished and relocated to a reservation in Oklahoma in 1875.  "

msgid "Upon entering the White House, Polk set four major goals for his presidency. He hoped to acquire some or all of Oregon territory, obtain California and New Mexico from Mexico, reduce tariff rates, and charter a permanent independent treasury. In 1846, Congress passed the Walker Tariff, which substantially lowered tariffs from their 1842 rates. The same year, Polk authorized the Independent Treasury System, under which all government funds were held in the Treasury instead of in private banks."

However, despite repeated warnings from Mexico that the [annexation of Texas](/humanities/us-history/civil-war-era/sectional-tension-1850s/a/annexing-texas) would lead to war, Congress in 1845 passed a joint resolution inviting Texas to join the Union. Texas accepted and became a state in December 1845. This angered the Mexican government so much that it refused to receive Slidell. Polk retaliated by sending troops into disputed territory to pressure Mexico into negotiating. The result was the Mexican-American War. "

msgid "**Ralph Waldo Emerson** and **Henry David Thoreau** were two of the most famous transcendentalists. In 1845, Thoreau moved to a cabin that he built on Walden Pond in Massachusetts and lived there for two years, two months, and two days. He chronicled the experience in his book ***Walden***, published in 1854, which explored the themes of nature, spirituality, self-reliance, and the simple life. Thoreau acknowledged the debt transcendentalism owed to Indian religious beliefs by paying homage to the Bhagavad Gita, a Sanskrit epic that is one of the foundational texts of Hinduism: “In the morning I bathe my intellect in the stupendous and cosmogonal philosophy of the Bhagvat Geeta, since whose composition years of the gods have elapsed, and in comparison with which our modern world and its literature seem puny and trivial.”$^2$"

Another of Emerson’s most famous works was the 1841 essay **“Self-Reliance,”** a defense of individualism, which emphasized nonconformity and personal responsibility.

msgid "**Francis Cabot Lowell**, an American businessman, began to to reform the manufacturing industry by hiring women and creating a centralized workplace. Lowell founded the **Boston Manufacturing Company** in 1813, building a few mills, the most famous of which was in Lowell, Massachusetts—a town that was named after Lowell himself. In contrast to many smaller mills, the Boston Associates’ enterprises avoided the Rhode Island system, preferring individual workers to families. These employees were not difficult to find. While young men could work at a variety of occupations, young white women had fewer options and more experience working with textiles. The Boston Manufacturing Company preferred this system since the women could be easily managed and restricted while living and working on factory grounds."

msgid "**Catherine Beecher**, the daughter of Lyman Beecher and sister of Harriet Beecher Stowe, pushed for women’s roles as educators. In her 1845 book, *The Duty of American Women to Their Country*, she argued that the United States had lost its moral compass due to democratic excess. Both “intelligence and virtue” were imperiled in an age of riots and disorder. Women, she argued, could restore the moral center by instilling in children a sense of right and wrong. Beecher represented a northern, middle-class female sensibility. The home, especially the parlor, became the site of northern female authority. This can be seen in James Peale's *The artist and his family*. The mother is the subject in the foreground, while the man is physically blocked by her figure, signifying the dominant role she plays caring for the children. "

msgid "In 1848, about 300 male and female feminists, many of them veterans of the abolition campaign, gathered at the **Seneca Falls Convention** in New York for a conference on women’s rights that was organized by Lucretia Mott and Elizabeth Cady Stanton. It was the first of what became annual meetings that have continued to the present day. Attendees agreed to a **Declaration of Rights and Sentiments** based on the Declaration of Independence. It declared, “We hold these truths to be self-evident: that all men and women are created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.” “The history of mankind,” the document continued, “is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations on the part of man toward woman, having in direct object the establishment of an absolute tyranny over her.”"

Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Lucy Stone, Lucretia Mott and Susan B. Anthony lead the movement. Anthony left such a legacy for the feminist cause that progressive women everywhere were called **Suzy Bs**. The public considered Elizabeth Cady Stanton quite radical for suggesting that women should have the right to vote in the 1840s."

msgid "Some northern female reformers saw new and vital roles for their sex in the realm of education. They believed in traditional gender roles, viewing women as inherently more moral and nurturing than men. Because of these attributes, the feminists argued, women were uniquely qualified to take up the roles of educators of children. This idea began in the late 1700s but was codified and gained support during the mid-1800s with the rise of the first women's rights movement. "

msgid "Women lead the charges in many antebellum reforms, from transcendentalism to temperance to abolition. While leading these reforms, women gained the political traction to begin the first wave of US feminism. Paradoxically, the **cult of domesticity**—the view that women should remain relegated to the household—played a role in encouraging women’s participation in public movements. Women who rallied for temperance, for example, highlighted their role as moral guardians of the home to advocate against intoxication. Some women argued for a much more expansive role—educating children and men in solid republican principles, like liberty and justice. "

msgid "In 1800, each state was allowed to choose its own voting day; thus, voting in the presidential election lasted from April through October. With only one state remaining—South Carolina—Adams and Jefferson were tied, with 65 electoral votes each. When South Carolina returned its results, it awarded the election to Jefferson. However, there were a number of disputed returns, and the election was ultimately decided in the House of Representatives."

The major foreign policy debate revolved around the appropriate American response to the [French Revolution](/humanities/world-history/1600s-1800s/french-revolution-tutorial/v/french-revolution-part-1). Jefferson and the Democratic-Republicans were sympathetic to France, while the Federalists leaned more toward Britain, fearing the growing radicalism of the French Revolution and attempting to prevent the United States from being drawn into the conflict. The Federalist party’s pro-British stance led to accusations that Adams and his compatriots were seeking to undo the political effects of the American Revolution and restore the monarchy."

msgid "Because Andrew Jackson had won more electoral votes than any other single candidate, he was embittered by the outcome and declared the election to be a \"corrupt bargain.”$^2$ Jackson alleged that Henry Clay, who served as Speaker of the House of Representatives at the time, had convinced the House to elect Adams—a charge made more believable by the fact that Adams, once in office, appointed Clay as Secretary of State. Although no evidence surfaced to indicate that Clay had actually corrupted the process, the accusations lent credence to Jackson’s portrayal of Adams as a defender of the elite against the interests of the common man."

This led to a further decline in Adams’s popularity and opened the way for Andrew Jackson to portray Adams as an eastern establishment elite who didn't care about the interests of the frontier settler or the common man.$^4$"

Comprised of several tribes, including the Shawnee, Kickapoo, Sauk, Fox, and Winnebago, a Native American confederacy led by Shawnee prophet **Tenskwatawa** and his brother **Tecumseh** had arisen to challenge US settlement in the territory. The British supported this confederacy in an effort to halt US westward expansion and protect British interests in Canada by creating an Indian buffer state between US territory and British Canada. These were the primary grievances of the United States against Britain, and the major reasons that war broke out in 1812."

General [Andrew Jackson](/humanities/us-history/the-early-republic/age-of-jackson/a/the-presidency-of-andrew-jackson) destroyed the military capabilities of the Creek nation in the Battle of Horseshoe Bend in March 1814. The battle occurred in the Mississippi Territory, which Jackson sought to clear for US settlement. Approximately fifteen percent of the entire Creek population was killed. The Treaty of Fort Jackson forced the Creeks to surrender twenty-three million acres of land and to promise to never again ally with the British or Spanish against the Americans. "

Britain also imposed trade restrictions on the Americans, refused to recognize US neutrality in the European war, and routinely violated neutral shipping rights.

The **Treaty of Ghent**, which formally ended the war, involved no significant change in pre-war borders or boundaries. With the end of the Napoleonic Wars, the British had already abandoned their policy of impressing American sailors, and had informally lifted restrictions on neutral trade. According the terms of the treaty, the British returned nearly four thousand Americans who had been classified as prisoners of war and forced into British service. With the major causes of the war thereby removed, the end of hostilities ushered in the “**Era of Good Feelings**,” during which US-British relations improved. The nation’s sense of victory and unity was enhanced by the dissolution of the Federalist Party and the consequent alleviation of bitter partisan divisions. "

msgid "While America had been a colonial territory of Great Britain, the British navy had protected American merchant ships from pirates. Now that the United States was an independent country, however, it had to provide its own protection. Pirates off the Barbary Coast frequently raided US merchant ships, looting goods and sometimes even kidnapping crew members and enslaving them or demanding a ransom for their return. This resulted in the **First Barbary War**, which took place from 1801 to 1805 off the coast of North Africa and was followed by a Second Barbary War in 1815."

Whereas Adams and his fellow Federalists, including George Washington, envisioned a strong central government and a thriving manufacturing sector centered in the cities, Jefferson and the Democratic-Republicans espoused an **agrarian ideal**, rooted in the republican virtues of the independent small farmer. The election of 1800 was fiercely contested and extremely acrimonious, and facilitated the rise of the two-party system and the spread of bitter partisanship."

Additionally, the Jefferson administration reduced the size of the Navy, ultimately bringing the national debt down from \\$83 to \\$57 million. Foreign developments, however, including the intensification of piracy along the Barbary Coast, would necessitate the rebuilding of the Navy and its establishment as a permanent part of the US government."

Adhering to new “apprenticeship” laws determined within the black codes, judges bound many young African American orphans to white plantation owners who would then force them to work. Adult freedmen were forced to sign contracts with their employers—who  were oftentimes their previous owners. These contracts prevented African Americans from working for more than one employer, and therefore, from positively influencing the very low wages or poor working conditions they received. "

This contradicted the Supreme Court’s 1857 **Dred Scott decision**, which declared that black people could never be citizens. President Johnson, who continued to insist that restoration of the United States had already been accomplished, vetoed the 1866 Civil Rights Act. However, Congress overrode his veto.

msgid "During **Reconstruction**, the period after the Civil War when the South reorganized its political, social, and economic systems to account for the end of slavery, federal troops occupied the South. These troops served to guarantee African American men's right to vote, and the Republican-controlled federal government would only end the military occupation when states rewrote their Constitutions to recognize the citizenship and voting rights of African American men. White Southerners generally despised these troops, and wanted an end to the intervention of the federal government in the South.$^2$ "

After slavery, government across the South instituted laws known as **Black Codes**. These laws granted certain legal rights to blacks, including the right to marry, own property, and sue in court, but the Codes also made it illegal for blacks to serve on juries, testify against whites, or serve in state militias. The Black Codes also required black sharecroppers and tenant farmers to sign annual labor contracts with white landowners. If they refused they could be arrested and hired out for work. "

msgid "As the Civil War wound to a close in 1865, African Americans in the South celebrated the end of slavery. They immediately began to take steps to improve their own condition by seeking what had long been denied to them: land, financial security, education, and the ability to participate in the political process. However, they faced the wrath of defeated white Southerners who were determined to keep blacks an impoverished and despised underclass. Recognizing the widespread devastation in the South, Congress created the Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen, and Abandoned Lands in March 1865, popularly known as the **Freedmen’s Bureau**. Lincoln approved of the Bureau, giving it a charter for one year."

msgid "By 1830, there were 7,000 settlers from the United States living in Mexican Texas. But tensions between the Mexican government and settlers from the United States grew as Mexico  unsuccessfully attempted to halt further immigration and settlers pushed back against Mexican legal codes.  These **regulatory laws** required those living in Mexico—including those living in Texas—to become Mexican, convert to Roman Catholicism, file legal documents in Spanish, and (after Mexico abolished slavery in 1829) end the practice of slavery. In reality, however, Mexico continued to allow settlers from the United States to bring slaves into the territory as “indentured servants.”"

Sam Houston, a previous Tennessee senator during the Jacksonian Democracy and prominent military figure, became the first president of the Republic of Texas. Citizens of the new republic were overwhelming in favor of Texas becoming a state in the United States—many motivated in part by concern that Mexico might try to re-establish its oppressive rule over Texas."

This granted residents of the territories to decide for themselves whether to allow slavery. Popular sovereignty conveniently followed the logic of American democracy; majorities in each territory would decide the territory’s laws. The compromise, however, further  fractured the country as votes on the bills divided along strict sectional lines."

msgid "Most Americans breathed a sigh of relief over the deal brokered in 1850, choosing to believe it had saved the Union. However, the compromise stood as a truce in an otherwise white-hot sectional conflict. Popular sovereignty paved the way for unprecedented violence in the West over the question of slavery. "

Kentucky senator Henry Clay, also known as the “**Great Compromiser**,” offered a series of resolutions, most of which aimed to limit slavery’s expansion. Clay answered Taylor’s request, calling for California to enter the Union as a free state. Yet he coupled this antislavery provision with a more robust federal fugitive slave law in hopes of sectional compromise."

msgid "The issue of slavery in the Mexican Cession consumed Congress at the end of the 1840s, among other related controversial matters. Antislavery advocates wanted to end the slave trade in the District of Columbia, while proslavery advocates aimed to strengthen **fugitive slave laws**. The contested border between Texas and New Mexico and the issue of California both remained unresolved. Many emigrants flocked to California upon the discovery of gold in the late 1840s, forcing the question of its statehood and status as a slave or free state."

Southern Mexican-American war military hero Zachary Taylor was elected as president in 1848, much to the satisfaction of southern slaveholders. While Taylor himself owned more than one hundred slaves, surprisingly he did not prioritize slavery’s expansion into the Mexican Cession.

However, President Taylor and Henry Clay’s inability to cooperate stalled the government’s resolutions on slavery. Taylor then became suddenly ill, reportedly after eating an excessive amount of fruit washed down with milk, and died within five days. Vice President Millard Fillmore took office and worked with Congress to flesh out the “final” terms of the compromise. "

Americans immediately wondered: Would the new states allow slavery? Anti-slavery advocates did not want to abolish slavery where it already existed; rather, they wanted to keep slavery out of the western territories for the benefit of white laborers settling in the area. Abolitionists, however, thought disallowing slavery’s expansion was key to slavery eventually becoming abolished. Southern extremists, especially wealthy slaveholders, reacted with outrage at this effort to limit slavery’s expansion. They vowed to leave the Union if necessary to protect their way of life and its western growth."

msgid "Despite all the precautions that white Southerners took to prevent slave rebellions, they did sometimes occur. In 1831, for instance, **Nat Turner**, an enslaved Virginia man whose owner had taught him to read and who was viewed as a prophet by the other enslaved men and women, organized an insurrection. The uprising began with the killing of Turner’s owner, and within 24 hours, the enslaved rebels managed to kill 60 white people. The revolt was ultimately crushed by law enforcement, and Turner and 13 other slaves were executed. The insurrection terrified white Southerners and resulted in the formulation of even more stringent legal codes governing the behavior of enslaved people.$^4$"

msgid "Democratic leaders sought to bind these disparate ideologies together. Illinois Democratic senator Stephen Douglas believed he had found a solution—the Kansas-Nebraska bill—that would promote party unity and also appease Southerners who detested the Missouri Compromise line. The act created two territories: Kansas, directly west of Missouri; and Nebraska, west of Iowa. The act applied the principle of **popular sovereignty**, dictating that the people of both territories would decide for themselves whether to adopt slavery. Most likely, Nebraska would enter as a free state and Kansas as a slave state. Since both territories fell above the 36° 30' line, the proposed bill would repeal the the Missouri Compromise of 1820.

A  man named **John Brown**, along with his four sons and a small group of followers, heard the news that an antislavery activist had been attacked in Lawrence, Kansas. Brown, a strict Calvinist and staunch abolitionist, once remarked that “God had raised him up on purpose to break the jaws of the wicked.” Brown and his posse went to the homes of proslavery settlers near Pottawatomie Creek, announcing they were the “Northern Army” as they burst into the cabin of proslavery Tennessean James Doyle and abducted him and two of his sons. Owen and Salmon Brown hacked the sons to death with broadswords and John Brown shot a bullet into Doyle’s forehead. Brown then brutally executed two other nearby proslavery settlers. None of those executed owned slaves or were involved in the incident at Lawrence. Brown’s actions precipitated a new wave of violence; Kansas soon became known as “**Bleeding Kansas**.”"

Sumner’s “Crime against Kansas” speech went much further than politics and prompted the attack. He insulted proslavery men, namely Senator Andrew Butler, by comparing slavery to prostitution: “Of course [Butler] has chosen a mistress to whom he has made his vows, and who, though ugly to others, is always lovely to him; though polluted in the sight of the world, is chaste in his sight. I mean the harlot Slavery.” "

Southern cotton, picked and processed by newly-profitable slaves, helped fuel the 19th-century **Industrial Revolution** in both the United States and Great Britain."

Of the border states, Maryland was particularly worrisome, because the US capital at Washington D.C. sat on its border with Virginia.

msgid "A mere two weeks later, on December 29, 1890, the US 7th Cavalry Regiment surrounded an encampment of Sioux Indians near **Wounded Knee Creek** on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in South Dakota. While attempting to disarm the Sioux, a shot was fired and a scuffle ensued. The US army soldiers opened fire on the Sioux, indiscriminately massacring hundreds of men, women, and children. The few Sioux survivors of the battle fled. In the aftermath of the massacre, an official Army inquiry not only exonerated the 7th Cavalry, but awarded Medals of Honor to twenty soldiers. US public opinion of the massacre was generally favorable. "

Though the practice of the Ghost Dance originated with the Paiute tribe of Nevada, it quickly spread to other Indian tribes in the Southwest. Wovoka’s most influential prophecy was that the white man would be forever banished from the land, and that the buffalo, which had been hunted to near-extinction by white settlers, would return and bring with it a lasting revival of the Native American way of life.$^1$"

msgid "From the earliest days of colonial contact between white Europeans and Native American Indians, certain key assumptions informed their interactions. Most native tribes did not adhere to the European view of land as property. For most Indians, land was communal, and its resources were to be protected and shared. This was in direct contradiction to European notions of land as individual property. As white settlers pushed ever westward, guided by the ideology of Manifest Destiny, they forced Native Americans off of their ancestral lands and onto reservations. Many Indian tribes resisted, unleashing a series of violent conflicts known as the [Indian Wars](/humanities/us-history/the-gilded-age/american-west/a/indian-wars).$^2$ "

msgid "From the earliest days of European colonization of the New World, relations between white Europeans and Native Americans were plagued by violent competition for land and natural resources. The Indian Removal Act of 1830 authorized the forced removal of numerous Indian tribes from their ancestral lands in the Southeast to what was designated “Indian territory” west of the Mississippi River. The Cherokee nation was subject to a brutal mass migration that came to be known as the Trail of Tears.$^1$"

This belief was often couched in religious terms; many white Christians argued that only by abandoning their spiritual traditions and accepting Christian dogma could the Indians be “saved” from the fires of hell.

msgid "Initially, the Dawes Act did not apply to the so-called “Five Civilized Tribes” (Cherokee, Chickasaw, Choctaw, Creek, and Seminole). These tribes had already adopted many elements of white European society and culture, which is why they were characterized as “civilized.” Moreover, they were protected by treaties that had guaranteed that their tribal lands would remain free of white settlers. However, after these tribes had proven unwilling to voluntarily accept individual allotments of land, the **Curtis Act of 1898** amended the Dawes Act to apply to the Five Civilized Tribes. Their tribal governments were obliterated, their tribal courts were destroyed, and over ninety million acres of their tribal lands were sold off to white Americans.$^3$ "

msgid "The Dawes Act of 1887, sometimes referred to as the Dawes Severalty Act of 1887 or the General Allotment Act, was signed into law on January 8, 1887, by US President Grover Cleveland. The act authorized the president to confiscate and redistribute tribal lands in the American West. It explicitly sought to destroy the social cohesion of Indian tribes and to thereby eliminate the remaining vestiges of Indian culture and society. Only by disavowing their own traditions, it was believed, could the Indians ever become truly “American.”$^2$"

His discovery of trace flecks of the precious metal in the soil at the bottom of the American River sparked a massive migration of settlers and miners into California in search of gold. The **Gold Rush**, as it became known, transformed the landscape and population of California.$^1$ "

msgid "Though the Gold Rush had a transformative effect on California’s landscape and population, it lasted for a surprisingly brief period, from 1848 to 1855. It did not take long for gold panning to turn up whatever gold remained in silt deposits, and as the extraction techniques required to mine for gold became increasingly complex, gold mining became big business. As the mining industry exploded, individual gold-diggers simply could not compete with the level of resources and technological sophistication of the major mining conglomerates. "

They came not just from the eastern and southern United States, but from Asia, Latin America, Europe, and Australia as well. Improvements in steamship and railroad technology facilitated this migration, which dramatically reshaped the demographics of California. In 1849, California established a state constitution and government, and formally entered the union in 1850.$^2$"

msgid "Though migration to California was fueled by gold-tinted visions of easy wealth and luxury, life as a forty-niner could be brutal. While a small number of prospectors did become rich, the reality was that gold panning rarely turned up anything of real value, and the work itself was back-breaking. The lack of housing, sanitation, and law enforcement in the mining camps and surrounding areas created a dangerous mix. Crime rates in the goldfields were extremely high. Vigilante justice was frequently the only response to criminal activity left unchecked by the absence of effective law enforcement. As prospectors dreaming of gold poured into the region, formerly unsettled lands became populated, and previously small settlements, such as the one at San Francisco, exploded. "

msgid "A homestead was a plot of land, typically 160 acres in size, that was awarded to any US citizen who pledged to settle and farm the land for at least five years. The only requirements were that the applicant must be at least 21 years of age (or be the head of a household) and the applicant must never have “borne arms against the United States Government or given aid and comfort to its enemies.”$^2$ After the [Civil War](/humanities/us-history/civil-war-era/slavery-and-the-civil-war/v/start-of-the-civil-war), this meant that ex-Confederate soldiers were ineligible to apply for a homestead. With the passage of the Fourteenth Amendment, which guaranteed US citizenship to African Americans and ex-slaves, homesteading became a possibility for freedpeople. And after a Supreme Court decision in 1898, immigrants became eligible to apply to the federal government for a homestead as well, though by that time, the best lands had already been claimed. "

This represented approximately ten percent of the entire landmass of the United States.$^3$ It was a massive transfer of land ownership from the federal government to individual citizens, and inaugurated a series of “land rushes,” during which homesteaders rushed in to settle the land on a first-come, first-serve basis.

In fact, the practice of governments awarding free land to settlers dates back to early colonial period, when the British encouraged settlement of the “New World” by granting settlers the claims to vast swathes of land. And ever since the **Northwest Ordinance of 1787**, which established the Northwest Territory (modern-day Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio, and Wisconsin) and prohibited the extension of slavery into that territory, land-grant legislation has been inextricably tied to the issue of slavery. A competition ensued over the admission of free states and slave states into the Union.$^1$"

George Pullman manufactured the nation’s most popular sleeping cars, and Pullman was so successful that he built a **company town** outside Chicago, where the 12,000 workers who built Pullman sleeping cars worked and lived. But when, in the spring of 1894, amid a general economic downturn and decline in prices nationally, Pullman cut workers’ wages without also proportionally reducing rents on the company-owned houses or prices of goods sold in the company-owned stores, workers struck."

msgid "Because of the mass appeal of the Populist movement, the Democratic Party began to champion many of its policy goals. In the 1896 presidential election, the Democrats nominated **William Jennings Bryan** as its candidate, and the Populists agreed to support him. The People’s Party was thus folded into the Democratic Party and began to fade from the national scene. The effect of the fusion of the Populist Party and the Democratic Party was a disaster in the South. Though there had always been conflict within the Populist movement about whether African Americans should be included, the Democratic Party in the South was unabashedly racist. Though Bryan performed strongly in the areas of greatest Populist influence, he lost the election to Republican William McKinley.$^4$ "

The crop-lien system operated in the cotton-growing South, among sharecroppers and tenant farmers, both white and black, who did not own the land that they worked. These workers took out loans to obtain the seed, tools, and other supplies they needed to grow the cotton. After the harvest, they were required to pay back the loans in the form of cotton crops. When cotton prices tanked, these workers were sometimes left with nothing after their crops were collected by creditors.$^1$"

msgid "From the late 1800s, the name Jim Crow came to signify the social and legal segregation of black Americans from white.  After the Civil War and Reconstruction, whites disenfranchised black men (by means of the poll tax, literacy test, and more), frequently relegated black workers to low-paying jobs, and poorly funded public schools for black children.  In this way, whites in the Jim Crow South crafted a bitter web of political, economic, and social barriers to full and equal citizenship for their fellow black citizens."

Summarizing the majority ruling, Justice Henry Brown wrote, \"We consider the underlying fallacy of the plaintiff's argument to consist in the assumption that the enforced separation of the two races stamps the colored race with a badge of inferiority. If this be so, it is not by reason of anything found in the act, but solely because the colored race chooses to put that construction upon it.\" $^3$"

In the Jim Crow South, it was illegal for black Americans to ride in the front of public buses, eat at a “whites only” restaurant, or attend a “white” public school.$^1$ "

msgid "[Rosa Parks](/humanities/us-history/postwarera/civil-rights-movement/a/the-montgomery-bus-boycott) wasn't the first person to challenge segregated transportation. More than fifty years earlier, an African American man from New Orleans named **Homer Plessy** challenged segregated train cars. In 1892, Plessy boarded a \"whites-only\" compartment on a train, and was arrested when he refused to move to a \"colored\" compartment when called upon to do so. (Plessy planned to be arrested, intending to test the constitutionality of Louisiana's segregation law by arguing that it violated the Fourteenth Amendment's guarantee of equal protection under the law for all citizens).

Beginning in the early 1880s, northern capitalists invested in building textile mills in the southern Appalachian foothills of North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia, drawn to the region by the fact that they could pay southern mill workers at half the rate of workers in northern mills. In consequence of the  low wages the mills gave only a modest boost to the southern economies in which they were built.$^3$"

He revolutionized industrial work by perfecting the assembly line, which enabled him to lower the Model T’s price from \\$850 in 1908 to \\$300 in 1924, making car ownership a real possibility for a large share of the population. Soon, people could buy used Model Ts for as little as five dollars, allowing students and others with low incomes to enjoy the freedom and mobility of car ownership.

Magazines like *Ladies’ Home Journal* and *The Saturday Evening Post* became vehicles to connect advertisers with middle-class consumers. Colorful and occasionally provocative print advertisements decorated the pages of these publications and became a staple in American popular culture. "

As technologies in engine and passenger compartment design improved, air travel became more popular. In 1934, the number of US domestic air passengers was just over 450,000 annually. By the end of the decade, that number had increased to nearly two million."

By the mid-1920s, men—as well as some pioneering women like the African American stunt pilot Bessie Coleman—had been flying for two decades. But there remained doubts about the suitability of airplanes for long-distance travel. **Orville Wright**, one of the pioneers of airplane technology in the United States, once famously declared, “No flying machine will ever fly from New York to Paris [because] no known motor can run at the requisite speed for four days without stopping.” However, in 1927, this skepticism was finally put to rest when **Charles Lindbergh** became the first person to fly solo across the Atlantic Ocean, flying from New York to Paris in 33 hours."

msgid "After Congress passed the [Volstead Act](/humanities/us-history/rise-to-world-power/1920s-america/a/prohibition) in 1919, which banned the manufacture and sale of alcoholic beverages, many Americans sought refuge in speakeasies and other entertainment venues that hosted jazz bands. Harlem’s Cotton Club was one famous venue, where both whites and blacks gathered to listen to jazz, dance the Charleston, and illicitly guzzle booze. Women attended jazz clubs in large numbers, and the “flapper girl” became a staple of US pop culture. These women flouted orthodox gender norms, bobbing their hair, smoking cigarettes, and engaging in other behaviors traditionally associated with men."

msgid "During the Progressive Era, calls for prohibition became more strident. In many ways, temperance activists were seeking to ameliorate the negative social effects of rapid industrialization. Saloons and the heavy drinking culture they fostered were associated with immigrants and members of the working class, and were seen as detrimental to the values of a Christian society. The Anti-Saloon League, with strong support from Protestants and other Christian denominations, spearheaded the drive for nationwide prohibition. In fact, the **Anti-Saloon League** was the most powerful political pressure group in US history—no other organization had ever managed to alter the nation’s Constitution."

The **American Temperance Society**, founded in 1826, encouraged voluntary abstinence from alcohol, and influenced many successor organizations, which advocated mandatory prohibition on the sale and import of alcoholic beverages. Many religious sects and denominations, and especially Methodists, became active in the temperance movement. Women were especially influential. The **Women’s Christian Temperance Union**, founded in 1873, was one of the leading advocates of prohibition. "

These policies helped to reduce the debt that the United States had incurred during World War I. However, as Europe began to recover, US exports to the continent dwindled. In an effort to protect US agriculture and other businesses threatened by lower-priced imports, Harding pushed through the Emergency Tariff of 1921. This defensive tariff had the effect of increasing American purchasing power, although it also inflated the prices of many goods."

The waning of the Red Scare took with it the last vestiges of Progressive zeal, and Wilson’s support of the [League of Nations](/humanities/us-history/rise-to-world-power/us-in-wwi/a/the-league-of-nations) turned Irish and German immigrants against the Democrats. Americans were tired of reform, tired of witch hunts, and were more than ready for a return to “normalcy.”"

msgid "The scandals mounted quickly. From 1920 to 1923, Secretary of the Interior Albert B. Fall was involved in a scam that became known as the **Teapot Dome scandal**. Fall had leased navy reserves in Teapot Dome, Wyoming, and two other sites in California to private oil companies without opening the bidding to other companies. In exchange, the companies gave him \\$300,000 in cash and bonds as well as a herd of cattle for his ranch. Fall was convicted of accepting bribes from the oil companies; he was fined \\$100,000 and sentenced to a year in prison. It was the first time that a cabinet official had received such a sentence."

Suffragists hoped that the lawsuits would work their way up to the Supreme Court, and that the justices would declare that women had a constitutional right to vote. In 1875, the Supreme Court, in *Minor v. Happersett*, rejected women’s suffrage, ruling that the US Constitution did not confer the right of suffrage to anyone.$^2$"

These two rival groups were divided over the Fifteenth Amendment, which guaranteed African American men the right to vote. The AWSA supported the Fifteenth Amendment, while the NWSA opposed it because it did not include suffrage for women. In 1890, the two competing organizations were merged into the National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA). "

Though many of her fellow suffragists were anti-war pacifists, Catt made the controversial decision to support the war and to thereby portray the women’s suffrage movement as patriotic. The effort was a success; in his 1918 State of the Union address, President Woodrow Wilson declared his support for female enfranchisement."

Many in the United States feared that if America didn't join the race for empire, the great powers would leave it behind.$^2$"

msgid "In line with their view of human nature as capable of being engineered and manipulated, many Progressive reformers advocated selective breeding, or **eugenics**. Eugenics was considered “the science of better breeding” and aimed to improve the genetic quality of the human population through policies that would encourage the more “desirable” elements of society to have more children while preventing “undesirables” from reproducing. Eugenics was based on a racial and class hierarchy that placed white, Anglo-Saxon Protestants at the top. Lower classes, ethnic minorities, recent immigrants, the mentally ill, and the developmentally disabled all occupied lower rungs on this hierarchy. In 1907, the United States became the first country to pass a compulsory sterilization law. "

"[President Hoover](/humanities/us-history/rise-to-world-power/great-depression/a/the-presidency-of-herbert-hoover) initially met the economic downturn from the perspective of his long-held **voluntarist** principles—that is, his belief in minimal government interference in the economy, as well as a conviction that direct public relief to individuals would weaken individual character, turn people away from the work-ethic, and lead them to develop a dependency on government handouts. \n"
"By 1931 Hoover reversed his earlier approach and embraced government intervention in the economy. The 1932 **Reconstruction Finance Corporation (RFC)** authorized the lending of \\$2 billion to banks, railroads, and other privately held companies, and in July 1932 the federal government appropriated \\$300 million for the nation’s first relief and public works projects.$^7$ "

The New Deal embraced federal deficit spending to promote economic growth, a fiscal approach that came to be associated with the British economist **John Maynard Keynes**. Keynes argued that government spending that put money in consumers' hands would allow them to buy products made in the private sector. Then, as employers sold more and more products, they would have the money to hire more and more workers, who could afford to buy more and more products, and so on.$^5$ In this way, Roosevelt and his supporters theorized, the Great Depression’s downward economic spiral could be  reversed.

They objected most vociferously to Article X of the League’s Covenant, which required all members of the League to assist any member threatened by external aggression. In effect, Article X would commit the United States to defending any member of the League in the event of an attack. Isolationists in Congress were opposed to any further US involvement in international conflicts and viewed Article X as a direct violation of US sovereignty. As a result, the Senate refused to ratify the treaty, and the United States never became a member of the League of Nations.$^6$"

By this time, the Allied powers had already begun to discuss the creation of a new successor organization, the United Nations. The United Nations, which is still in existence today, was based on many of the same principles as the League of Nations, but was designed specifically to avoid the League’s major weaknesses. The UN boasts much stronger enforcement mechanisms, including its own peacekeeping forces, and the membership of the UN is substantially larger than that of the League even at its peak."

The Irreconcilables saw this as a violation of US sovereignty and some believed that it would commit the United States to an alliance system that could lead to another war. Due to the opposition of the Irreconcilables, the Treaty of Versailles was never ratified by Congress, and the United States never became a member of the League of Nations.$^5$"

He called for an immediate end to the war, the establishment of an international peacekeeping organization, international disarmament, open diplomacy, the explicit disavowal of war, and independence for formerly colonial territories. Wilson’s Fourteen Points were hugely influential in shaping the contours of the postwar world and in spreading the language of peace and democracy around the world.$^2$ "

msgid "At the same time, civil liberties were sharply curtailed. The **Espionage Act of 1917** and the **Sedition Act of 1918** criminalized the expression of antiwar sentiment and criticism of the US government and armed forces. Voluntary associations were created to identify dissidents, and many of these worked together with the Federal Bureau of Investigation to patrol the home front and punish perceived “enemies.”$^6$"

A few days after this announcement, the Wilson administration obtained a copy of the [Zimmermann Telegram](/humanities/us-history/rise-to-world-power/us-in-wwi/v/zimmermann-telegram), which urged Mexico to join the war effort on the side of Germany and pledged that in the event of a German victory, the territories of Arizona, Texas, and New Mexico would be stripped from the United States and returned to Mexico. The publication of the Zimmermann Telegram and the escalation of German submarine attacks on US merchant vessels led the US Congress to [declare war on Germany](/humanities/us-history/rise-to-world-power/us-in-wwi/v/united-states-enters-world-war-i) on April 6, 1917.

Many questions remain about the necessity of using the bomb and its moral implications: Would the United States have acted so quickly to use nuclear weapons against Europeans? Was racism against the Japanese an element in the decision? Might the United States have exploded a nuclear bomb on an uninhabited island to demonstrate the bomb’s terrible power instead of destroying two cities? Might the United States have been able to gain Japan’s unconditional surrender by other means?  "

msgid "Because the Soviet Union and the United States both held permanent seats on the UN Security Council, as the [Cold War](/humanities/us-history/postwarera/postwar-era/v/origins-of-the-cold-war) heated up, disunity between the two great powers interfered with the international organization’s basic peacekeeping mission. This was partly due to the dual nature of the UN as a forum for negotiating disputes among states and a platform for influencing international opinion. The Soviet Union and the United States both used the UN as a propaganda platform, to win hearts and minds in the Cold War. Many of the proposals submitted by US and Soviet officials were aimed primarily at criticizing each other, and since each superpower had a veto in the Security Council, disputes could not be resolved unless both Cold War rivals agreed, which was rare. This had the effect of stalling negotiations and prolonging conflict.$^4$"

Cars allowed Americans who lived in the suburbs to commute easily into urban areas for work. Cars not only changed work and housing patterns, but also facilitated the rise of new sexual norms. They provided young couples with a place to spend time together alone, away from the prying eyes of parents and other members of the community. This, in turn, led to a rise in premarital sex and birth rates. Thus, patterns of sexual behavior were changing even as the traditional ideal continued to insist upon marriage before sex."

msgid "After waging a successful guerrilla war against the regime of Cuban dictator Fulgencio Batista, Fidel Castro came to power on January 1, 1959. Castro was not yet a communist, and US policymakers initially took a cautious wait-and-see approach to his regime. Over the course of 1959 and 1960, US-Cuban relations worsened due to Castro’s anti-US rhetoric and radical policies, especially his refusal to hold elections. When it became clear that Castro intended to pursue an alliance with the Soviet Union, President [Dwight Eisenhower](humanities/history/euro-hist/1950s-america/a/the-eisenhower-era) cut off diplomatic ties to Cuba and began preparing contingency plans for overthrowing Castro and replacing him with someone more amenable to the United States.

After the expiration of his parole, he became involved with the Nation of Islam, serving as its emissary on a visit to the Middle East and Africa in 1959, and becoming the minister of Mosque No. 7 in Harlem. Malcolm X’s fiery rhetoric and charismatic presence gained the Nation of Islam many new adherents in the late 1950s and early 1960s. The Nation of Islam advocated black self-empowerment and self-reliance, as well as cultural and racial pride. The most famous Black Muslim was undoubtedly the heavyweight boxer Cassius Clay, who changed his name to **Muhammad Ali** after converting."

msgid "Though the GI Bill itself did not bar female or African American veterans from enjoying its benefits, discrimination at the structural level often limited the GI Bill's benefits to white men. Though the program was federally funded, its implementation was directed at the state and local level by the Veterans Administration (VA), which was almost entirely white and closely affiliated with the pro-segregation American Legion. VA job counselors frequently steered African American veterans who applied for tuition benefits towards vocational training instead of university courses. In some cases, black applicants were told that they needed no further education, since the job market had no place for blacks as skilled workers--only as menial laborers.$^1$ "

This classification often resulted in job loss, loss of custody, and other serious personal consequences for people in the LGBT—lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender—community. By 1974, the APA had ceased to classify homosexuality as a form of mental illness but continued to consider it a “sexual orientation disturbance.” "

For example, **Patsy Mink**, the first Asian American woman elected to Congress, was the coauthor of the **Education Amendments Act of 1972**, **Title IX** of which prohibits sex discrimination in education. Mink had been interested in fighting discrimination in education since her youth, when she opposed racial segregation in campus housing while a student at the University of Nebraska. She went to law school after being denied admission to medical school because of her gender. Like Mink, a number of other women sought and won political office, many with the help of the **National Women’s Political Caucus**, or NWPC. In 1971, the NWPC was formed by Bella Abzug, Gloria Steinem, Shirley Chisholm, and other leading feminists to encourage women’s participation in political parties, elect women to office, and raise money for their campaigns."

In 1973, the US Supreme Court in ***Roe v. Wade*** affirmed a number of state laws under which abortions obtained during the first three months of pregnancy were legal. This made nontherapeutic abortion a legal medical procedure nationwide."

The Nixon administration had already halted the federal policy of termination and restored millions of acres to tribes. Increased funding for Native American education, healthcare, legal services, housing, and economic development followed, along with the hiring of more Native American employees in the BIA."

msgid "The most dramatic event staged by AIM was the occupation of the Native American community of Wounded Knee, South Dakota, in February 1973. [Wounded Knee](/humanities/us-history/the-gilded-age/american-west/a/ghost-dance-and-wounded-knee), on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation, had historical significance: it was the site of an 1890 massacre of members of the Lakota tribe by the US Army. The federal government surrounded the area with US marshals, FBI agents, and other law enforcement forces. A siege ensued that lasted 71 days. There was frequent gunfire from both sides; two Native Americans were killed and a US marshal as well as an FBI agent were wounded. "

The amendment passed Congress in March 1972, and was sent to the states for ratification with a deadline of seven years for passage; if the amendment was not ratified by 38 states by 1979, it would die. Twenty-two states ratified the ERA in 1972, and eight more ratified it in 1973. In the next two years, only four states voted for the amendment. In 1979, still four votes short, the amendment received a brief reprieve when Congress agreed to a three-year extension, but the amendment never passed due to the opposition of socially conservative grassroots organizations."

At the same time, real wages began to stagnate. Simultaneous inflation and stagnation, nicknamed **stagflation**, puzzled economic analysts: usually, when wages fell, prices fell, and when wages increased, prices increased. But not in the 1970s. As a result, Americans had less purchasing power, and increasingly expensive American exports were at a disadvantage in the international market. In 1971, the United States experienced its first unfavorable international trade balance since 1893.$^3$ "

msgid "What caused this slump? The massive cost of the war in Vietnam and the expansion of social programs at home without commensurate tax increases helped to drive inflation (the price of goods and services). Meanwhile, US manufacturing (especially automotive manufacturing) had become less competitive over time compared to efficient overseas rivals, particularly in Germany and Japan. More and more American jobs were in the service sector, which had lower wages and fewer benefits than manufacturing jobs. Individuals born on the tail end of the baby boom found themselves competing in a very crowded labor market, especially as more women and immigrants entered the workforce.$^4$"

Congress also had passed the **Boland Amendment**, limiting US assistance to the Contras in Nicaragua, citing evidence that they had tortured and murdered civilians.

msgid "President Reagan’s supply-side economic policies, often called **Reaganomics**, set out to grow the economy by cutting taxes and deregulating some industries. Supply-side economics depended on the idea that corporations and wealthy individuals would reinvest the money they saved by paying lower taxes to build businesses, create jobs, boost profits, and spur economic growth. In Reagan’s first year in office he engineered a three-stage 25 percent income tax reduction. In the **Tax Reform Act of 1986**, the top marginal rate (the tax paid by the highest income earners) was lowered to 28 percent.$^6$   "

During my first press conference as President, in answer to a direct question, I pointed out that, as good Marxist-Leninists, the Soviet leaders have openly and publicly declared that the only morality they recognize is that which will further their cause, which is world revolution. I think I should point out I was only quoting Lenin, their guiding spirit, who said in 1920 that they repudiate all morality that proceeds from supernatural ideas—that's their name for religion—or ideas that are outside class conceptions. Morality is entirely subordinate to the interests of class war. And everything is moral that is necessary for the annihilation of the old, exploiting social order and for uniting the proletariat."

Bin Laden was one of the founders of **al-Qaeda**, a radical Sunni Islamist terrorist network that has attacked civilian and military targets in numerous countries.

Though the military claimed that these incidents were the work of a few bad apples, the investigatory reports by human rights organizations reflected a much broader pattern of abuse.

msgid "In 1856, clashes between antislavery **Free-Soilers**, or people that opposed the expansion of slavery, and border ruffians came to a head. A man named **John Brown**, along with his four sons and a small group of followers, heard the news that an antislavery activist had been attacked in Lawrence, Kansas. Brown, a strict Calvinist and staunch abolitionist, once remarked that “God had raised him up on purpose to break the jaws of the wicked.”$^1$ Brown and his posse went to the homes of proslavery settlers near **Pottawatomie Creek**, announcing they were the “Northern Army.” They burst into the cabin of proslavery Tennessean James Doyle and abducted him and two of his sons. Owen and Salmon Brown hacked the sons to death with broadswords and John Brown shot a bullet into Doyle’s forehead. Brown then brutally executed two other nearby proslavery settlers. None of those executed owned slaves or were involved in the incident at Lawrence. Brown’s actions precipitated a new wave of violence; Kansas soon became known as “Bleeding Kansas.”"

msgid "Douglas responded to Lincoln during the second debate at Freeport, Illinois. In what became known as the **Freeport Doctrine**, Douglas adamantly upheld **popular sovereignty** declaring: “It matters not what way the Supreme Court may hereafter decide as to the abstract question whether slavery may or may not go into a territory under the Constitution, the people have the lawful means to introduce it or exclude it as they please.” The Freeport Doctrine antagonized white Southerners and contributed to the section divide of the **Democratic Party.** "

msgid "In 1857, the Supreme Court decided the case of ***Dred Scott v. Sandford***. Dred Scott (Figure), born a slave in Virginia in 1795, had been one of the thousands forced to relocate as a result of the massive internal slave trade. His first owner, Peter Blow, sold him to John Emerson, who took Scott and his wife to Missouri, where slavery had been adopted as part of the **Missouri Compromise**. But in 1820, John Emerson left Scott with his brother John Sanford (misspelled Sandford in court papers) who took Scott  to Illinois and then to the Wisconsin territory. Critically, both of those regions were part of the **Northwest Territory**, where the **1787 Northwest Ordinance** had *outlawed* slavery. When Scott returned to Missouri, he attempted sued in the state courts for his freedom. He claimed that his residence in a free territory made him a free man. His case made it all the way to the Supreme Court."

msgid "Lincoln’s election prompted Southern states to begin leaving the Union. In December 1860, Kentucky Senator John Crittenden proposed a final attempt to keep the southern states from seceding before the Civil War broke out. The **Crittenden Compromise** included six possible constitutional amendments and four Congressional resolutions. The Crittenden Compromise would have reestablished slavery in all states south of the **36°30′ line**, and made slavery illegal in all states north of the boundary, effectively reinstating the **Missouri Compromise of 1820**. But it failed to pass Congress, and Lincoln rejected it. The Crittenden Compromise was the last attempt to mitigate sectional divisions over slavery before the Civil War erupted. $^1$"

In 1608 he founded Quebec, and he made numerous Atlantic crossings as he worked tirelessly to promote New France. Unlike other imperial powers, France—through Champlain’s efforts—fostered especially good relationships with native peoples as they expanded westward. He learned that becoming friendly with the native people was essential to successful trade. Champlain explored the Great Lakes, Hudson Bay, and eventually made it to the  Mississippi River. The French made an alliance with the **Hurons** and **Algonquians**; Champlain even agreed to fight for them against their enemy, the **Iroquois**. "

msgid "Dutch entrance into the Atlantic World is part of the larger story of religious and imperial conflict in the early modern era. In the 1500s, **Calvinism**, one of the major Protestant reform movements, began to take root in the Spanish Netherlands and the new sect desired its own state. Holland was established in 1588 as a Protestant nation, but would not be recognized by Spain until 1648. Determined to imperil Protestantism, King Philip of Spain assembled a massive force of over thirty thousand men and 130 ships, and sent this giant navy, known as the **Spanish Armada**, towards England and Holland. But the skilled English navy and a maritime storm destroyed the fleet in 1588. The defeat of the Spanish Armada was only one part of a larger but undeclared war between Protestantism and Catholicism.

msgid "Elizabeth did sanction an early attempt at colonization in 1584, when Sir Walter Raleigh attempted to establish a colony at **Roanoke**, an island off the coast of present-day North Carolina. The colony was small, consisting of only 117 people, who seem to have alienated the native Croatan people. They struggled to survive. Their governor, John White, returned to England in late 1587 to secure more people and supplies. When he returned in 1590, only three years later, the entire colony had vanished. The only trace the colonists left behind was the word **Croatoan** carved into a fence surrounding the village. Roanoke is still called **“the lost colony,”** and what happened to the colonists is still a mystery. However, English promoters of colonization would continue to explore the New World in the years to come despite this curious failure."

msgid "However, English colonization efforts in the 1500s were closer to home, as England devoted its energy to the colonization of Ireland. **Queen Elizabeth I** was preoccupied with blocking Spain’s effort to eliminate Protestantism. Still, Elizabeth encouraged English privateers to plunder Spanish ships whenever they could. Each year the English took more than £100,000 from Spain in this way; English privateer Sir Francis Drake first made a name for himself when, in 1573, he looted silver, gold, and pearls worth £40,000.

In the early sixteenth century, it joined the race to explore the New World and exploit the resources of the Western Hemisphere. In 1534, navigator **Jacques Cartier** claimed northern North America for France, naming the area around the St. Lawrence River **New France**. Like many other explorers, Cartier made exaggerated claims about the area’s mineral wealth and was unable to send great riches back to France or establish a permanent colony. "

They relied on native hunters to harvest furs, especially **beaver pelts**, and to exchange these items for French goods, like glass beads. The French also dreamed of replicating the wealth of Spain by colonizing the tropical zones. After Spanish control of the Caribbean began to weaken, the French turned their attention to small islands in the West Indies; by 1635 they had colonized two, Guadeloupe and Martinique. Though it still lagged far behind Spain, France now boasted its own West Indian colonies with lucrative sugar plantation sites and African slave labor."

Like many explorers of the time, Hudson was actually seeking a northwest passage to Asia and its wealth, but the wealth of coveted beaver pelts alone provided a reason to claim it for the Netherlands. The Dutch named their colony **New Netherlands**, and it served as a fur-trading outpost for the expanding and powerful Dutch West India Company. They expanded in the area to create other trading posts, where their exchange with local Algonquian and Iroquois peoples brought the Dutch and native peoples into alliance. The Dutch became a commercially powerful rival to Spain--Amsterdam soon became trade hub for all the Atlantic World. "

msgid "In 1927, the world of the silent movie began to wane with the New York release of the first **“talkie”**—*The Jazz Singer*. The plot of this film, which starred Al Jolson, told a distinctively American story of the 1920s. It follows the life of a Jewish man from his boyhood days of being groomed to be the cantor at the local synagogue to his life as a famous and “Americanized” jazz singer. Both the story and the new sound technology used to present it were popular with audiences around the country. It quickly became a huge hit."

Film production was originally based in and around New York, where Thomas Edison first debuted the kinetoscope in 1893. But in the 1910s, as major filmmakers like D. W. Griffith looked to escape the cost of Edison’s patents on camera equipment, this began to change. When Griffith filmed *In Old California*—the first movie ever shot in Hollywood, California—in 1910, the small town north of Los Angeles was little more than a village. As moviemakers flocked to southern California, not least because of its favorable climate and predictable sunshine, Hollywood swelled with moviemaking activity. "

The verdict sparked protests from Italian and other immigrant groups as well as from noted intellectuals such as writer John Dos Passos, satirist Dorothy Parker, and famed physicist Albert Einstein. Muckraker Upton Sinclair based his indictment of the American justice system, the “documentary novel” *Boston*, on Sacco and Vanzetti’s trial, which he considered a gross miscarriage of justice. "

As a defendant, the ACLU enlisted teacher and coach **John Scopes**, who suggested that he may have taught evolution while substituting for an ill biology teacher. Town leaders in Dayton, Tennessee, for their part, sensed an opportunity to promote their town—which had lost more than one-third of its population—and welcomed the ACLU to stage a test case against the Butler Act. The ACLU and the town got their wish. The **\"Scopes Monkey Trial,\"** as it was publicized by the newspapers, quickly turned into a carnival that captured the attention of the country and epitomized the nation’s urban-rural divide."

msgid "The negative opinion many native-born Americans held toward immigration was in part a response to the process of postwar urbanization. Cities were swiftly becoming centers of opportunity, but the growth of cities—especially the growth of immigrant populations in those cities—sharpened rural discontent over the perception of rapid cultural change. As more of the population flocked to cities for jobs and quality of life, many left behind in rural areas felt that their way of life was being threatened. To rural Americans, the ways of the city seemed sinful and extravagant. Urbanites, for their part, viewed rural Americans as hayseeds who were hopelessly behind the times."

Nevertheless, the trial itself proved to be high drama. The drama only escalated when Darrow made the unusual choice of calling Bryan as an expert witness on the Bible. Knowing of Bryan’s convictions of a literal interpretation of the Bible, Darrow peppered him with a series of questions designed to ridicule such a belief. The result was that those who approved of the teaching of evolution saw Bryan as foolish, whereas many rural Americans considered the cross-examination an attack on the Bible and their faith. "

There was no direct evidence linking them to the crime, but—in addition to being immigrants—both men were anarchists who favored the destruction of the American market-based, capitalistic society through violence. At their trial, the district attorney emphasized Sacco and Vanzetti’s radical views, and the jury found them guilty on July 14, 1921. "

msgid "To “preserve the ideal of American homogeneity”, the **Emergency Immigration Act of 1921** introduced numerical limits on European immigration for the first time in US history. These limits were based on a quota system that restricted annual immigration from any given country to 3% of the residents from that same country as counted in the 1910 census. The **National Origins Act of 1924** went even further, lowering the level to 2% of the 1890 census, significantly reducing the share of eligible southern and eastern Europeans since they had only begun to arrive in the United States in large numbers in the 1890s. Both labor unions and the [Ku Klux Klan](/humanities/us-history/rise-to-world-power/1920s-america/a/the-reemergence-of-the-kkk) supported the bill.

Noyes also promoted “male continence,” whereby men would not ejaculate, thereby freeing women from pregnancy and the difficulty of determining paternity when they had many partners. Intercourse became fused with spiritual power among Noyes and his followers."

Their expedition lasted from 1803 to 1806 and was aided tremendously by the help of a Shoshone woman, **Sacagawea**, who served as their guide. Without Sacagawea’s immense knowledge of the land and the Indian tribes that inhabited it, Lewis and Clark’s expedition could easily have met with disaster."

msgid "Jefferson adhered to a strict interpretation of the Constitution and believed that without a specific enumeration of his right as president to acquire the purchase, buying the Louisiana Territory could plausibly be unconstitutional. The Federalists opposed the purchase for several reasons, chief among them the likelihood that new slave states would enter the Union from the southern parts of the territory. Despite Federalist opposition and the contested constitutionality of the purchase, Jefferson agreed to the deal, which almost doubled US territory. He said to his Cabinet regarding the Purchase: “\"it is the case of a guardian, investing the money of his ward in purchasing an important adjacent territory; & saying to him when of age, I did this for your good.” $^1$ Jefferson was correct to assume that the Louisiana Territory would be an important element to the United States’ future."

Enormous clouds of gnats and mosquitos swarmed about their heads as they made their way up the Missouri River. They encountered (and killed) a variety of animals including elk, buffalo, and grizzly bears. One member of the expedition survived a rattlesnake bite. As the men collected minerals and specimens of plants and animals, the overly curious Lewis sampled minerals by tasting them and became seriously ill at one point. They sketched and documented over 260 plants in their journals, a majority of them new to scientific discovery. They also made the first scientific discoveries of many bird species, reptiles, and mammals.  Yet as new settlers came to make their lives on the [western frontier](/humanities/ap-us-history/period-4/apush-age-of-jackson/a/manifest-destiny), preserving these newfound species was hardly their concern.   $^2$"

Of 176 electoral votes cast, all but 14 were in his favor. The great expansion of the United States achieved by the Louisiana Purchase did receive criticism, though, especially from northerners who feared the addition of more slave states and a corresponding lack of representation of their interests in the North. For southern slaveholders, new western lands would be a boon; for enslaved people, the **Louisiana Purchase** threatened to entrench and expand their suffering to western territories."

As early as 1872, civil service reformers gathered to create the Liberal Republican Party in an effort to unseat incumbent President Grant. Led by several midwestern Republican leaders and newspaper editors, this party provided the impetus for other reform-minded Republicans to break free from the party and join the Democratic Party ranks. With newspaper editor **Horace Greeley** as their candidate, the party called for a “thorough reform of the civil service as one the most pressing necessities” facing the nation. Although easily defeated in the election that followed, the work of the Liberal Republican Party set the stage for an even stronger push for patronage reform."

msgid "Guiteau shot the president from behind and continued to shoot until police grabbed him and hauled him away. He went to jail. The following November after Garfield had died, Guiteau stood trial for murder. His poor mental health, which had been evident for some time, led to eccentric courtroom behavior that the newspapers eagerly reported and the public loved. He defended his case with a poem that used religious imagery and suggested that God had ordered him to commit the murder. He also justified himself in court by saying, “The doctors killed Garfield, I just shot him.” While this in fact was true, it did not save him. Guiteau was convicted and hanged in the summer of 1882."

First, he adopted a new patronage rule, which held that a person appointed to an office could be dismissed only in the interest of efficient government operation but not for overtly political reasons. Second, he declared that party leaders could have no official say in political appointments, although Conkling sought to continue his influence. Finally, Hayes decided that government appointees were ineligible to manage campaign elections."

Arthur had been notorious for using his post as customs collector to gain political favors for Conkling. When Hayes forcibly removed him from the position, even Half-Breeds questioned the wisdom of the move and began to distance themselves from Hayes. The loss of his meager public support due to the [Compromise of 1877](/humanities/ap-us-history/period-5/apush-reconstruction/a/compromise-of-1877) and a declining Congressional faction together sealed Hayes fate and made his reelection impossible."
