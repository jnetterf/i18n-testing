"*   **Energy points:** [__energy points__](https://khanacademy.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/202487710-What-are-energy-points-) can be a rough estimate of effort, but some students may quickly figure out how to “game the system” if there’s too much of an emphasis placed on them.  Use energy points to motivate students, but make sure to triangulate this information with more details about the specific student activities (e.g. if they are working on skills that they should be working on) be wary of students watching videos on end or completing lots of skills that are too easy for them.\n"
"*   **Struggling:** Seeing lots of red in your reports isn’t necessarily a bad thing.  Struggling is part of learning, and we want students to feel safe practicing and attempting difficult skills.  Encourage students to use hints and videos, seek help from peer tutors, and provide in-person support when necessary.  When students finally master a skill that initially gave them trouble, recognize them not only for learning it but also for persevering and displaying a [growth mindset](/curriculum-k12/a/motivate-students/).\n"
"*   **Time:** There are a few different ways we calculate the time students spend on Khan Academy. One way we calculate it is by estimating Total Minutes based on content consumed (ex. watching an 8 minute video), the other is an estimate of the Time Active on site (ex. 10:30am-11:15am).  "

Amanda believes that this technique is especially useful for students who have math anxiety and a lack of confidence in school.  Using metrics such as badges and energy points, Amanda uses a weekly leaderboard to recognize students who go above and beyond."

Stations were divided into three areas: two stations focused on Khan Academy - one for the current unit and one for students finished with the current unit, and in a third session Suney led a small group session with the students who needed additional help with the current lesson. At the whiteboard, there was a list to facilitate peer tutoring. On the left was the column, \"I need help with\" where the student with a question would write their name and the exercise, and on the right was a \"I can help\" column where the peer tutor would fill in their name when the request was completed."

msgid "At the very beginning, the whole class started at the very top of the knowledge map, reviewing basic skills starting with addition.  Twice a week, for forty-five minutes, I gave students free reign on Khan Academy.  Because the first exercises were extremely easy for the students, their confidence and motivation levels soared as they easily breezed through the top portion of the knowledge map. High-fives, clapping, dancing, laughing, and smiling filled the room as students passed effortlessly through addition, subtraction, and the beginnings of multiplication and division.  They marveled at the fact that they needed no help, could do everything mentally, didn’t have to watch any videos or show any work.  This state of confident bliss was short-lived as more and more students began to struggle with concepts and topics that were never learned or forgotten.  This was the time to introduce the Khan Academy Journal and the Need Help/Can Help board."

In this lesson, we discussed the difference between helping someone by explaining as opposed to just giving out answers.  We also discussed the benefits of peer-tutoring to both the helper and the recipient.  Part of this discussion also included revisiting the classroom culture we were striving to achieve in our class.  I reminded them about acceptance and respect for each other, and I reiterated the different learning styles and paces represented in the classroom.  It was very important for me to validate the importance of peer-tutoring as a norm in our classroom and to make sure that it was to be done in a way that would be respectful, caring, and all the while preserving everyone’s dignity."

msgid "On the day I introduced Khan Academy to the class, I began by telling them that they were going to be part of something BIG, AMAZING, and that perhaps they would be part of something monumental in all the world.  I continued to pump them up using words like “trailblazer”, “pioneer”, and “cutting edge”.  Then I explained to them what TED talks are, the significance of TED talks, and we proceeded to watch Sal Khan’s TED talk on Khan Academy.   My concerns that the language would be over their heads were assuaged when I saw my students listening and engaged with Sal’s words.  In a discussion that followed the video, many students shared how they were able to relate to feeling bored when they had to sit through countless lessons about math that they already knew.  Others shared their feelings of confusion and sadness when they had no idea what was going on in class.  They needed help and more individual attention but would have to move on without either into the next world of confusion.  My students understood and related to the Swiss cheese holes that Sal explained.  Sal’s words, Bill Gates, my introductory set, the ability to relate, and word that they would be using their very own laptops made for a class that was “ooing” and “ahhing” and completely sold on the idea.  The students’ vulnerability with each other about their own math histories brought our class closer, and this was an integral step in developing a safe classroom environment.  Students were beginning to share, empathize, sympathize, and “know” each other.  In this type of setting, peer tutoring thrived because no one felt judged and ashamed, nor did anyone act haughty and pretentious about their math dexterity.  Help was requested and help was given in a very natural and sincere way."

Students would use it twice a week in forty-five minute time blocks.  This was my way of slowly and cautiously getting my toes wet with Khan Academy while still maintaining “control” of the math curriculum and my own teaching.  Although I was carving out time for this new way of learning, I refused to let it encroach on what I was already doing. Khan Academy was definitely “on the side”."

msgid "I spent a great deal of time between first and second semester trying to figure out how I could fold Khan Academy into my math curriculum.  How could I use it to help me teach the content to my students?  After days and maybe even weeks, an idea began to form, and soon after, I pictured some sort of syllabus/map that would include Khan Academy as a teaching resource.  This was the birth of the unit packets.  Each unit would have its own packet to guide the students through the content.  One column would list the learning objective, the second column would list the videos on Khan Academy that teach the topic, a third column would name the exercises on Khan Academy that students would need to practice and pass, and the final column would be a list of textbook lessons and practice pages that students would be responsible for.  Having this packet as a guide, students could move through the unit independently, slowing down if they needed help, and continuing forward if they were ready.  Peer tutoring and mini-lessons would be happening simultaneously alongside the independent work.  Students would be working at their own pace, getting individualized help, and working right where they should be.  I would be “free” during this time to teach/reteach small groups and help struggling students.  I could picture it, and when the day came for it to actually happen, it worked!   Because the behavioral, structural, and community norms had already been established since the beginning of the school year, moving my class into this next phase of Khan Academy was a smooth transition.  Kids were motivated, enthusiastic, and felt elevated with this new sense of independence and control over their learning.  I was holding my breath but then began to release and breathe.  I felt as though a miracle had happened; as though a “cure” had been discovered.  It all happened right there in my classroom, right before my eyes."

msgid "In the summer of 2011, my colleague (7th/8th grade math teacher, Jen Johnson) and I were approached about piloting Khan Academy in our classrooms.  Although I tried to keep a calm demeanor, my initial internal reaction was an emphatic “no!”  Being afraid of change and the thought of needing to learn and do one more thing on top of everything else, the idea of piloting something new made me anxious and overwhelmed.  I could have said no and I would have said no, but there was a part of me that knew change was necessary in my math instruction.  In all my years as a teacher (at that point 12 years), I was never satisfied with the way I was teaching math.  I was successful and creative in the lesson-making and delivery, but I knew that I wasn’t reaching and teaching every student.  I knew with certainty that there were students who were completely bored with the lesson because they had already learned and mastered the material in previous grades.  Then there were the students who were completely confused because I was moving too quickly without giving them enough time to comprehend and practice.   It was shameful and painful to know that my instruction was not meeting all the students’ needs.  I knew it, but I didn’t know how to address the problem.  I tried differentiating the class and material into three cohorts: low, middle, high.  I divided my classroom into three separate spaces for each group, and then I modified the material to challenge the high group and support the low group.  However, managing three groups in one classroom, creating three levels of practice materials, and also addressing individual student needs made this system almost impossible to sustain on my own.  It always started out strong with lots of purpose and momentum, but this action plan would eventually fizzle out due to problems with management, physical space, lack of time, and upkeep difficulties.  So, to make things easier, I would revert back to the “old” way of teaching; whole group lesson, same practice examples, same homework practice, and then same assessment.  If a student got it, good.  If a student didn’t get it, I’d try to find time after school or before school to offer help.  If there was no time, the student would move on with a huge “hole” in their math understanding, and I would feel terribly, terribly guilty.  I knew this wasn’t the right way to teach.  And so, despite my fear and trepidation, I agreed to learn more about Khan Academy.  After watching Sal’s TED talk and attending a Khan Academy workshop for teachers, I knew that I had to participate in the pilot program.  It was a possible solution to my desire to reach and teach every student.  Not participating would have compromised my integrity as a teacher.  The Khan Academy pilot began in the 2011-2012 school year and has continued ever since."

msgid "In this second phase of Khan Academy implementation, I was still holding back.  Yes, I did incorporate Khan Academy into my curriculum.  Yes, I did let students work at their own paces, allowing them to move forward or slow down based on their need.  Despite these two leaps, I knew there was another that I had to take.  Up until that point, students were able to work at their own paces, but only up to a certain point.  If the unit was Fractions, they could start and finish the unit work, but that was it.  I was not letting them proceed to the next unit.  Rather, I had them work on different projects related to Fractions until everyone in the class caught up to them.  Then, as a whole class, we’d move onto the next unit together.  The biggest reason for doing this was that I did not think I could handle the mayhem and pandemonium that could arise from more than one unit happening at one time in one classroom.  What would that look like and how could I manage all of it?  However, if I truly released control to let the students work at their own pace without holding them back or keeping them busy with extra work, I had to let them proceed to different units and new units.  I had to let go of those remaining reigns that were keeping my students where I wanted and needed them to be.  It was not 100% student-centered yet."

msgid "My career in teaching began in a suburb of Chicago, Illinois.  I taught 5th grade for five years before moving to California.  After a one-year teaching job in San Diego as a 6th grade math and science teacher, I moved to the Bay area and began teaching 6th grade at Eastside College Preparatory School.  Eastside College Preparatory School is a 6th-12th grade independent school in East Palo Alto whose mission is to serve students historically underrepresented in 4-year colleges.  Eastside students are the first in their families to attend college; they create a ripple effect, changing their own lives, the lives of their families, and the life of their community.  The 2013-2014 academic school year will mark my ninth year teaching 6th grade at Eastside. Eastside is an extended-day school with the day starting at 8am and ending at 5pm.  There is only one 6th grade class, 7th grade class, and 8th grade class.  The 6th grade class is the only self-contained class at Eastside.  I teach all subjects:  math, science, social studies, language arts, and reading.  Every year I have 24 sixth graders, all coming from different elementary schools in the neighborhood and surrounding communities.  Because it is a self-contained classroom, these new students are able to begin their Eastside journey as a tight-knit family.  Creating a close and safe class community is always my number one priority.  I believe that this must be the foundation in order for learning to take place. Part of the community-building is introducing the students to the new behavioral and academic standards/expectations.  I tell the students that they are in this together; that they must look out for one another’s well being and growth as a student.  We establish that every student is important, must be accepted just as they are, and unique in their strengths and areas to improve.  This sense of family and community has been vital to student success and to the successful implementation of Khan Academy into our math curriculum."

msgid "The quantitative data from my classroom has shown improvement in math achievement.  Compared to the data from my teaching without Khan Academy, I’ve found that more students are passing unit tests and final exams.  With the traditional teaching model, on average, there would be about 5-6 students (out of 24) who were not able to pass with a 70% or higher.  Out of these, many scored way below 70%, with scores of 20%, 30%, 40%.  It was clear that these students did not learn the unit content.  Although I’ve always required all students to make test corrections, I struggled finding time to help these students one-on-one.  To my shame and dismay, students moved right along to the next unit without addressing the struggles of the previous unit.  There were so many holes and compounding holes.  In the years using Khan Academy and integrating it fully into the math curriculum and my math instruction, I’ve seen some quantitative differences.  First, the number of students who didn’t pass unit tests and/or the final exams decreased to about 2-4\\.  And of these students, their scores were almost always in the 60-69% range.  They were very close to passing.  In addition, because of the new math model using Khan Academy, I had time to meet with every student who did not pass.  We had time to go over and talk about each problem.  The students were then able to make corrections with awareness of what they did wrong or with new clarity about the concepts.  And 100% of the time, they passed the post-test retake.  Thus, students moved on to the next unit only after the holes were filled."

msgid "Another aspect of Khan Academy’s qualitative impact on students was to instill qualities such as empathy, sympathy, kindness, concern for others, reciprocity, understanding, and mutual respect.  Students who were once very self-focused when it came to time, materials, interest, and needs became students who would often put their classmates’ needs before their own.  Rather than make their own progress with the Khan Academy exercises, they chose to spend their work time helping someone who was struggling with an exercise.  I was almost brought to tears when I’d see students helping each other in such a caring, respectful, and supportive way.  Their voices were gentle, nonthreatening, and they never brought shame onto anyone.  Because there was so much help being distributed in different combinations around the classroom, everyone knew about everyone else’s progress, struggles, and successes.  It was a joy to see the whole class clapping for a student who finally passed a unit, or to see a large gathering around a student who was about to become proficient in an exercise module.  They were just as nervous and excited as the student himself!  It was common in math class to hear cheers, claps, positive shout-outs, and to see pats on the back, thumbs-up signs, and smiles.  It was also common to see students gathered around a student who just discovered that she did not pass the post-test.  They would bring over a box of tissues, they’d offer hugs of encouragement, and they’d say things like, “I know how you feel.  You’ll be okay.  I know you will pass next time.”"

msgid "Khan Academy has also impacted me both professionally and personally.  When the journey began, I had no idea that it would lead to such profound meaning.  This Khan Academy adventure has taught me about growth mindset, about letting go, about taking risks, about the value of change and struggle, and about how to view and live life in general.  Because of my experience with Khan Academy, I realized that I had been underestimating the abilities of my students, myself, and that I often chose status quo for the sake of comfort or fear.  These realizations were not just useful for me as a teacher, but what I learned can also be applied to other areas of life. I also realized that amidst the daily grind, the long to-do lists, the papers, grading, planning, and organizing, I had lost and forgotten what the “center” of teaching is.  The center is the student.  Khan Academy helped me and challenged me to get to the “center” again."

msgid "Khan Academy’s impact on students was quite noteworthy in my classroom.  Quantitatively, because students were able to work at their own pace and receive proper attention for mathematical “holes”, their performance on tests and final exams improved.  Although there were students who did not pass with 70% or higher, when compared to similar students from previous years, this year’s students scored higher, with scores mainly in the range of 60%-69%.  When students from previous years did not pass a test, I saw much lower percentages ranging from 20%-50%.  An interpretation of this, alongside my own anecdotal notes, could be that rather than knowing barely anything and struggling through the test as a whole (previous students), the students who did not pass this year almost passed.  Their work on tests did show conceptual understanding; they were able to solve parts of problems and more importantly, they knew what was going on.  Computational errors, inability to finish problems to completion, and confusion about what the questions were asking contributed to their non-passing grades.  With the use of Khan Academy and with more personalized attention and instruction as a whole, students learned more and had fewer/smaller holes."

msgid "Qualitatively, Khan Academy’s impact on students was incredible.  Because students were able to navigate themselves through the curriculum, they took ownership of their learning.  They controlled the pace, they set their own goals, and they knew how they were doing.  This sense of ownership resulted in increased motivation levels, engagement, excitement, and purpose.  Students developed skills that aren’t quantifiable.  They learned how to push through a struggle, how to ask for help, how to help others, how to approach problems from different angles, and how to be a proactive learner.  In addition, students experienced grit, perseverance, frustration management, the thrill of reaching a goal, and realized that they have the means within themselves to make something happen or not happen.  These habits of mind are invaluable and are in congruence with the growth mindset.  These traits are not limited to one subject or one experience; they are good for life."

msgid "_Kristin Goff is a 5th grade teacher at Garden Valley Elementary in Idaho. Her students use missions as a daily supplement and sometimes as homework. They use KA as a way to peer tutor each other, get more individual time with their teacher, and as a way to continue practicing math after they are done with their assigned tasks for class.  Below, Kristin shares her experience about using Khan Academy as a tool to help students work at their own pace._  "

I’m able to give personalized attention to students and focus on the unique needs of each individual.  The kids are all engaged and helping each other. And there are smiles. Lots and lots of smiles. The change in atmosphere is palpable. I don’t stand at the helm and drive the boat along while all my disciples row in unison. I am rowing with them. Constantly checking data and redirecting the crew. When a man goes down, I am using data to send aid. When there is a group off course or in uncharted waters, I am pulling them aside to guide their next direction. It’s beautiful and fluid and looks like….well, chaos.  But within this chaos there are students learning with a renewed enthusiasm for math, tackling their fears, and supporting each other."

"            In Montessori primary and elementary classrooms, students work independently and at different levels making use of the Montessori materials to support their learning. Math learning in Montessori is constructive learning- students learn through using the materials, constructing the math concepts as they go. It is a very mastery-based style of education that invites the student to take age appropriate responsibility. Montessori teaching methods build upon the idea that children have a natural curiosity and drive to learn.  \n"
"            At the secondary level, there can be skepticism about how to make this style of math learning work. When I came to RMS, I started with just one level of math. I knew I would be adding a second level of math the following year, so I was working hard to figure out a good system for running two levels of math within in the same classroom. I had been reading about flipped classrooms, and was searching for video lesson resources. I had remembered watching Khan Academy videos in the past, and so I went to the site. I was so excited to find that there were now exercises available to go along with the videos. I quickly realized that this was going to be a tremendous resource for creating the kind of a classroom that I wanted.  \n"
"            Now I run three levels of math in the same classroom. My class has a mix of students taking Pre Algebra, Algebra I, and Geometry. Each group receives a weekly work list to guide them in their work. I rotate working with each group throughout the week. Additionally, there is a process for students to sign up to give lessons to their peers or to be a tutor at our “tutor bar.”"

msgid "            Just start! It can be overwhelming at first to try to learn the site. I recommend just setting up a personal account and be a learner for a while. Watch videos, do exercises, and get an overall feel for the learner experience. Then, create accounts for a handful of students and do a pilot run using the coach resources. As the site becomes more familiar, teachers will figure out the best ways to incorporate Khan Academy into their own classrooms."

"            Khan Academy supports the Montessori philosophy at the secondary level in so many ways. It supports our mixed-age learning environment, as well as our focus on mastery of concepts and skills.  Khan Academy also supports the idea that students are the number one stake-holders in their own learning.  \n"
"            Another thing that I believe to be compatible with Montessori philosophy about the Khan Academy approach is that the site uses the word “coach” rather than teacher, just as Montessori uses the term “guide”.  I’ve heard Salman Khan explain that a coach supports, but the athlete does the work. In our math classroom, the students are the mathematicians. I am there to support, guide, and inspire them to see their own potential."

"            One of the cornerstones of a Montessori program is a mixed-aged, multilevel classroom. We believe that students become better prepared for life when they are in a setting that allows them to interact and learn with students of different ages and different levels. In this a kind of classroom, my role as the teacher is to provide the support and systems for such individualized learning to take place, as well as enough content for all students to have the appropriate work.  \n"
"            In my classroom Khan Academy exercises and videos are a part of our content. The exercises and relevant videos are a part of students’ weekly work lists. The site allows me to more easily provide content for multiple courses and multiple levels within the same the classroom space. Additionally, the coach resources help me to more easily track student progress, so that I know best how to guide the student in his/her next steps.  \n"
"            I have used Khan Academy to create a new kind of homework policy in my classroom. Students are no longer assigned problem sets for homework. Instead, our middle school has a time-based homework policy. In my classroom students are asked to work on math for 30 minutes each night, and what they do in that 30 minutes is up to them (within reasonable limits). They quickly realize that it is to their benefit to do homework from the weekly work list that supports what we are learning in class. This kind of homework policy encourages student ownership of learning. When students feel like they are in charge of their math homework, they more fully understand the purpose and usefulness of homework. In fact, by mid year, students are regularly completing several hundred problems each week!"

msgid "With the help of Khan Academy, we found early results very encouraging. This year’s Algebra Readiness and Algebra 1 students scored consistently higher on solving equations, absolute value and the first semester final exams. That margin grew substantially for the most rigorous test on systems of equations (from 37 percent to 74 percent). This suggested that improved habits through the Khan Academy approach were creating real improvements among students. This evidence of superior performance was reinforced by the increased portion of scores above 80 percent on all of the tests."

Therefore, a 5th grade student can simply start the “5th grade mission”, and Khan Academy’s adaptive software and instant feedback can guide students on their individual learning path. This allows them to practice the skills, understand which ones they have truly mastered, and where they need to focus more effort.  "

"*   Hold a \"rocket run\" : Divide the class into teams. Project the Real Time report. Give one team three minutes to earn as many energy points as possible while other teams watch. Repeat for all teams. The team with the most points wins. (Thanks to teachers in the Los Altos School District for this idea!)  "

There’s scientific evidence that the neural connections grow and become stronger the more you struggle with learning and correct your mistakes.  Based on research by Stanford Professor [Carol Dweck](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh0OS4MrN3E) and her colleagues, we know that students with a **growth mindset** - _the belief that intelligence is not just something that you are born with_ - have higher levels of success than those with a fixed mindset.  Teaching your students about this concept has the potential to make them grittier, more positive, and more successful in their career and everyday lives.

msgid "Recently, I decided to go back to school before I have to sign up for disability benefits from Social Security. Mastering elementary algebra is a prequalifcation for most technical vocations at the community college level. I've been polishing my algebra skills (and arithmetic) for 4 months and **I doubled my initial score on the ACCUPLACER Exam using Khan Academy**. I'm recently enrolled in a brand new technology program at a community college in Maine. I start the new program in the fall '13\\. I have some more work to do on the Khan Academy web site to attain mastery but, I would not be this successful in my academic pursuit if it weren't for Khan Academy. Thanks so much for your existance and methods used to teach me what I've learned in such a short time._  "

For several weeks I watched videos and practiced with my 19 and 23 year old children. The test questions were completely covered by your site and in fact, I did place out of the pre-req- and the one class above!

"> My father, who was a math teacher, would give me and my siblings math problems instead of bedtime stories. It is a great memory I have of growing up, and now as a father of two children, I hope to instill in them that same passion for learning that my father gave me… I watched your “Basic Addition” video with my daughter Lily, who is 3 ½ years old. It was a neat memory for us and I just wanted to say thank you for the impact you’ve made in our lives and in the lives of children and people across the world. I wish you continued success and look forward to what is in store for Khan Academy.\n"

Teaching your students about this concept has the potential to make them grittier, more positive, and more successful in their careers and everyday lives."

msgid "I discovered distinct learning differences between my own children. When I began tutoring others, I encountered even more learning styles. What worked well for one did not necessarily work well for others. It made me realize that many students leave class or school feeling inadequate, when in fact they just need the information delivered in a different way - which can't always be addressed in a large class setting. That is why those very same students can perform well when they have a tutor who can try different deliveries until one approach works… LD students in particular are able to revisit subjects here in the comfort of their own home, where stressors and distractions are minimal. They can pause, replay, and even prepare in advance. They have an opportunity to take in the information on terms that work for them - especially for those that do not learn well by just reading textbooks. I also find that you consider the questions that might pop up for someone who is learning more slowly because you are so careful to explain everything in minute detail."

msgid "I had never planned on it and I was not a teacher, but I found myself homeschooling my son due to some LD needs that could not be met at a traditional school - even though we tried many interventions. I later wound up homeschooling both of my children. One is now in her junior year in college and the other begins college next fall and has passed state testing with flying colors."

msgid "I'm homeschooling three of my children now grades 4, 6, and 11\\. Because I have so many different grade levels, it can be difficult to explain each lesson to each child. One of my children has autism, so he struggles more with focusing on my lectures. However, he loves watching videos and learning online. This site is perfect for classrooms at school sites and at home! Not only that, I recommend it to parents that have trouble helping their children with their homework. Thank you so very much for offering these videos for free. I am excited to share your vision and look forward to the future of education at Khan Academy"

At first, I asked Nate to spend five hours on Khan Academy each week, but we soon switched from time-based goals to skill-based goals. Now, Nate tries to reach “Practiced” on 2-3 skills from the Algebra I mission each day,"

He goes at his own pace and is already working on material several grades above his level."

msgid "> My son and I have personally learned with Khan Academy's math curriculum this year, and we can honestly say he has learned far more with this curriculum than with any of the other typical homeschooling math curriculums. It's wonderful because the lessons can be completed independently by the student, or homeschooling parents can watch the videos with their child and pause them to discuss/clarify concepts when needed. When doing Khan Academy lessons, I feel that my son, Khan Academy, and I are a dynamic learning team!"

Accordingly, Khan Academy goes beyond what is required of it by law to provide numerous extra precautions for our younger learners, including restricting accounts for learners under the age of 13 (“Restricted Users”) to automatically block them from being able to post or disclose personal information, enabling parental controls, and working with prominent industry groups who are focused on the protection of children online.

msgid "I took my daughter out of school age 8 when I realised she could not add 2 + 2, and indeed was becoming terrified of maths. (we live in the UK). I tried firstly to help her myself, but she was convinced she couldn't do it, and would not even try. Tutors came and went, to no avail, she would just cry silent tears, and things got worse, if possible! So I decided to just leave it for a while. She is intelligent and great in other areas, so I was sure things would click one day. Roll forward 6 years - a few weeks ago I was reading an article in the paper about \"maths anxiety\" - which was interesting, but one of the commentators of the article included a link to Khan Academy. Oh My Goodness! From the very first video - we had to go back to basic addition - I could see this was going to be different! She loved the way that Sal explained EVERY little detail, but not in a patronising way. For the first time in her life, she has just finished a maths session and said \"I enjoyed that\" - music to my ears, and such a relief. LOVING the programme, learning stuff myself too:)"

msgid "My son experienced 3 concussions due to sport in one year and had to remove himself from grade 9 high school in Canada. He was so distraught that he would likely not pass his first year of high school that he fell into a depression. As his mother, it was awful to witness that all my fun-loving son could do was lie on the couch and watch YouTube videos in short windows. He discovered TED talks  that led to the Khan Academy story. He connected with these amazing lessons and used it to slowly rebuild his brain. He used the short intensive Khan Academy videos to pass his grade 9 by taking online tests administered by a board of education tutor who witnessed him writing them at home. The Khan Academy helped to rebuild my son's confidence and now he is super interested in math and science and using the Khan Academy to augment his grade 10 class learning and doing exceptionally well. He has fostered a new way to teach himself and has chosen to jump ahead in school to grade 11\\. This set of lessons on YouTube has re-engaged my son into learning -Thank you"

msgid "Our son Sam is in 2nd grade. He has a self-motivated love of learning. We have struggled from the day he entered Kindergarten to find a way to keep him interested in school while being so much more advanced than the other students. Public schools are not equipped to handle advanced learners and we were concerned that he would become bored with school and lose interest in learning. The school suggested moving him up a grade level, but when your 2nd grader is testing at Junior High levels, a move to 3rd grade is meaningless."

He loves math and treats learning new things like it is a video game – taking more pride in accomplishing a new skill than in beating the next level of Mario Brothers. He will beg permission to get on Khan Academy the way he used to beg for more time with the Nintendo. The challenge of learning a new skill, besting his completion streaks, and earning badges has been a godsend."

In addition, I created and met the goal of beginning Khan Academy on the first day. After that was achieved, I added the goal of continuing with KA until the last day of school. This was easy because this class LoVeD Khan Academy. It is evident in the data. As a class, they mastered 4,432 modules. Energy points were very motivating for my 4th graders. Collectively, they earned over 14,295,000! Usually, their homework consisted of spending 20 minutes on the site mastering skills on the playlist. Consistently, they invested many more minutes than were required. All together, ‘my’ kids spent more than 160,272 minutes (or 4,338 hours). My highest girl progressed all the way to writing expressions and my highest boy mastered measurement precision. I love Khan Academy for this reason.

msgid "_In a blended learning environment, students learn, at least in part, through online learning that gives them some element of control over time, place, path, and pace. At least part of the student learning experience is in a real school setting and, most importantly, what happens online is __not__ disconnected from the classroom. In fact, what happens online actively informs what’s happening in the classroom._"

msgid "_Moodle, a free, e-learning platform used to provide learning resources for students_**Study Guides / Playlists** allow me to set individual or class goals and develop timelines to keep my students on task, both in class and at home. They can also be guides for in-class grouping based on learning style and content mastery. Students can rotate through learning stations individually or in small groups for targeted or small group instruction. My class often rotates between my instructor led sessions and a computer lab. Sometimes, all students are working through an entire study guide (or playlist). At other times, groups are focused on concepts they’re struggling with."

msgid "For instance, one question I get quite often is “what if a student just sits on Khan Academy and doesn’t do any work?”  This is the kind of question that students like to ask at the beginning of the year, and it reflects  a “you are making me do this” mentality.  I love this question because of the absurd logic of it.  I have lots of different responses but the gist is this: “What we are doing here is for you, I cannot truly force you to do anything, but I can tell you that I have put a lot of thought into making this a valuable year for you.  If you waste the time and the opportunities that we are creating for you, then it’s on you, not me.  If you want to sit on a computer and do nothing, feel free not to come in at all - there is no judgement, this is just not the place for you.  If you don’t like what we are doing talk to me, if you don’t like it you are not wrong, but opting out completely is not an option.  There are hundred of kids that want the spot that you are sitting in and please remember that this is both an honor and a responsibility.”  From day one I refuse to be the enemy or the enforcer, I want to be the mirror and the asker of difficult questions."

The outer circle is working silently on Khan Academy goals.  The group on Khan Academy must keep a written record of their work.  They must be working on agreed upon material to get time on topic points. They cannot make small talk.  The small talk rule is not because I don't understand the need for it, it is because the inside group does not function well with outside noise.  If the outer group needs to collaborate, they may also work in the hallway or in my office."

msgid "I primarily grade students on their Khan Academy work by how much time they have put in on the exercises that are appropriate to their goal.  The way I did this last year was to go to each individual student and look at their activity report for the last two weeks.  This was a about a 2-3 hour process.  This had improved dramatically in the newest reports that Khan has released.  Using the by student report you can get the amount of time that each student has put in over a given period of time in a single report.  If you decide to use Khan, I promise that you will appreciate this.  The new report does not break down in a single screen where that time was spent but that information on a per student basis is one click away.  My strategy next year will be to drill down to individual student level for topics that I see students struggling on (also available in this activity report) and students who I suspect might be spending time on Khan but not on exercises that we have agreed that they will work on."

msgid "My initial goal for Khan Academy was to have it supplement material that I was already using in the classroom.  From the first day, I was able to find ways to use it effectively.  I was already using a self-paced curriculum, but I used worksheets and frequent advancement assessments.  I matched Khan Academy videos and exercises to the materials related to one unit that a group of my students were struggling with.  By initially using the Khan Academy site to supplement a small part of my curriculum I was able to work through the learning curves and figure out what I thought would be useful in my classroom on a broader scale."

msgid "One of the reasons I made the switch was the ease of use of the Khan Academy interface.  Other teachers had asked me to run a workshop on how to effectively implement the program I was currently using and despite the workshop, many of those teachers became frustrated with the learning curve necessary to become proficient with this other application.  I wanted to use a program that I could recommend to other teachers and feel like they could begin using effectively right away."

msgid "One reason that I have stayed with Khan Academy is that it is highly adaptable.  The site provides tools - but does not dictate how the tools should be used or force users to follow any path through their site.  This was important to me because I value the autonomy I have in curriculum design, I value my choices as a teacher, and I do not think that there is a single best way to approach learning or teaching.  I welcome tools that I can use to design my own solutions but am wary of sites or programs that enforce or their own pedagogy. Over time, as I decided on my own best practices, I integrated my classroom with the site quite a bit.  But even on the first day I was able to give kids extra practice and extra resources."

msgid "Reporting was also a key reason for switching to Khan.  The reports provided me with actionable data that I used to plan my days. When students came into class ,I had a plan ready for them based on what the reports were telling me about where they were progressing.   For example, if there was a group of 6 students who were struggling with linear equations, I would allow that group to work as a study group in the hallway.  If not, I could assign a peer tutor to work with those students.  I could check on that same group after class and see if improvements had been made or if they were still struggling."

There’s scientific evidence that the neural connections grow and become stronger the more you struggle with learning and correct your mistakes.  Based on research by Stanford Professor [Carol Dweck](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh0OS4MrN3E) and her colleagues, we know that students with a **growth mindset** - _the belief that intelligence is not just something that you are born with_ - have higher levels of success than those with a fixed mindset.  Teaching your students about this concept has the potential to make them grittier, more positive, and more successful in their career and everyday lives."

msgid "If you are limited by devices, create stations that students can rotate through. We recommend at least 30 min in each station so that students have ample time to actually practice problems and watch videos. At the Khan Academy station, students can work on their corresponding missions, skills aligned to class lessons, or a mix of both! During rotations, see how your students are progressing and intervene when appropriate. If you are unable to help students as they use Khan Academy, encouraging peer tutoring is a way to help the students help themselves as they learn."

msgid "During the 2013–2014 school year, the J.A. and Kathryn Albertson Family Foundation supported a statewide pilot initiative for Khan Academy in Idaho.  A group of 173 teachers, 10,500 students, one funder, a local university, and a small team from Khan Academy—all came together to explore the possibilities of personalized learning.  In Spring 2015, FSG published [this report](http://www.fsg.org/publications/learning-gets-personal) on its findings. This report highlights five key principles in adopting personalized learning on a mass scale, case studies of teachers who participated in the pilot, and an analysis on their students' overall academic success."

I’ve begun to incorporate more collaborative activities into my classroom—for example, by having students work on skills activities in pairs or small groups. I believe the students make significant cognitive and content-understanding gains by asking each other questions and in effect teaching each other the skills."

So I wheeled a set of school iPads into my classroom and introduced my students to the Khan website. Their response was even more enthusiastic than my own. They quickly started using the site to practice skills, earn “energy points,” and demonstrate mastery. I was excited about the instructional opportunities this kind of tool might present."

Once they meet their goals, they create new ones. On my classroom door, I post students’ names along with the Khan “energy points” they’ve earned and the number of skills that they’ve mastered. The students become increasingly optimistic that they can improve their achievement and their future opportunities through their own effort."

Now I’m finding ways to reach all of my students, many of whom enter our school several grade-levels behind in math."

As the students work independently or in pairs at their computer work stations, I regularly pull students who need a smaller-group setting to access the day’s lesson. I also group students that need support with the language and background information, and I sit and work with students in ones or twos to address specific issues. Everyone in the room is working at their own level and pushing themselves forward at their own pace. By providing lesson scaffolds in various ways, I am able to make sure that all of my students, regardless of their individualized learning plan goals or English-language learning classification, are working on grade-level standards."

msgid "My basic approach is to plan a general mini-lesson that targets a specific common-core standard, emphasizing problem-solving and conceptual understanding. I then look at the skills-progress report generated by the Khan site and group students based on their levels of progress on the standard in question. Students who have shown mastery in the skill complete a short exit ticket as they enter the classroom and then head to their laptops to go deeper into the topic or explore new topics. Students who need practice or are struggling with the standard complete some warm-up exercises and then take part in my mini-lesson. I scaffold the instruction by modeling and using visual representations to solve the problems along with them. The students then go to their laptops to continue their practice on the standard. At that point, I often bring together the more advanced students to work on a separate activity related to the skill we’re working on."

msgid "Next year, I’ll be taking on a new position as the math instructional coach in my school. I’m looking forward to working with my colleagues in my school and around the nation on improving and scaling up this blended-learning model. It has helped me see new possibilities in instruction and improved my ability to address students’ individual needs—something that is huge for me, as I know it is for all teachers. I’m looking forward to sharing what I’ve learned about the power of truly personalized math instruction."

msgid "Once or twice a week, I project the whole-class skills-progress report to give the students a sense of where we are as a cohort and to give them an idea of who is working on the same skills. I frequently confer with students individually to give them feedback on the choices they’ve made in selecting what skills to practice and what exercises to use. Early in the year I go over strategies that they can use if they are stuck in deciding how to progress. In these ways, I aim to build the students’ sense of autonomy and independence and their ability to find their own solutions—characteristics they will need to succeed in later grades. Technology allows for the personalization of their character development as well as their academic development."

At the beginning of every unit, I create posters that list the Khan Academy exercises aligned with our current unit of study from our curriculum scope and sequence. After choosing between Khan Academy and ST Math, a game-based instructional software program, students look at their individual skills-progress reports to decide what they need to practice and then work the exercises at their own pace. Once they have completed the [playlist](/coach-res/reference-for-coaches/how-to/a/create-and-implement-a-playlist), they can demonstrate their curiosity by exploring new topics."

Los Altos teachers used mobile labs to supplement their curriculum, and students were encouraged to work on math concepts they found challenging. Teachers used Khan Academy data to create more time in their schedules for hands-on, creative projects. Los Altos plans to roll out Khan Academy across these 4 grades this coming school year."

msgid "The introduction to programming starts with a 'human computer' activity. They execute a small program by hand to draw on graph paper. Working with partners, some students are able to make the drawing. \"It is a house!\" they shout out, excited about turning these strange lines of code into art. It is not an easy exercise for a sixth grader - understanding the parameters of the functions and then finding co-ordinates on an inverted graph paper (the origin in this graph paper is on the top left) . The struggle of this unfamiliar exercise helps them understand and appreciate program execution."

Others jump in, entering random numbers for the function parameters. They are exploring programming. Will they really be able to write in a line of their own code now?  Will it work?"

For the third year in a row, ALearn has integrated Khan Academy into its academic curriculum, serving 100% of the students enrolled in its programs with significant practice using KA. ALearn students showed remarkable results and success using Khan Academy to supplement the curricula used in the classroom. Rather than losing competency in math over the summer, these students gained significantly. In the words of an ALearn middle school TA, “Khan Academy was definitely a major strength in this program.”"

Many of these students, especially low income students, then suffer “summer learning loss” and actually lose 2-3 months of math proficiency over the summer, falling further behind their peers - and accounting for over two-thirds of the achievement gap between low-income students and their higher-income peers."

Students use the CollegeTrackMath website to determine which exercises to complete and track progress.\n"
"*   Students \"Below\" Benchmark are scheduled into one hour-long workshop with direct intervention and instruction. Khan is used for extension within the hour for students who either finish collaborative activity early or require further remediation practice. Outside of the workshop, students are expected to use their Individual Learning Plan to navigate Khan exercises that cover objectives taught in the workshop each week for additional practice and mastery."

They identified a Khan Academy implementation as an organizational priority, authorized the purchase of technology for the purpose of using KA, were instrumental in developing KA professional development for all Academic Directors, and supported the development of our student progress portal to make information about student performance on KA easily accessible to students and staff. This portal, www.collegetrackmath.org, was developed by one of Aurora's volunteers, and we began working on version 2.0 later in spring 2013."

msgid "[[☃ image 1]]We started using Khan Academy in the fall of 2011 in Aurora when we opened our Colorado site. Our goal when was to help students improve their math skill gaps. We had recruited a class of 60 students who had just begun 9th grade at Rangeview High School, and all 60 were committed to going to college. But we were shocked by some of the missing basic math skills - multiplication, division, adding and subtracting integers, anything to do with fractions, etc. While math teachers at RHS were working hard, the curriculum at the school - an integrated math program - rarely gave students the opportunity to practice these basic skills. We viewed our after school tutoring and workshop program as a place where we could provide dedicated students an opportunity to practice important math skills."

This person is a certified secondary mathematics teacher with ten years teaching experience, and three years experience working at our center, both as a tutor and as a math workshop instructor. The Academic Affairs Director and Academic Coordinator program students for their work on Khan Academy based upon the ACT Test, Khan Academy correlations, and the students' demonstrated ability to successfully work independently. All programming information is kept in students' academic profile folder, which is regularly accessed by the students, tutors and the Khan Coordinator, who also provides backup tutoring support to students working on Khan. Students' progress is regularly monitored by the KA Coordinator and Academic Resource Specialist, as well as the Academic Affairs Director. The lab coordinator provides scaffolding and direction to students as they work through programmed material, allows them to reflect upon their session, and keeps documentation of student progress. Students are scheduled for Khan for at least one hour per week. Many also take the opportunity to work on KA during their drop-in tutoring sessions as well. Homework tutors provide extended tutoring support in areas covered in KA."

msgid "Parent Anna Glynne saw the school invest in another online math program, but that technology only provided content at a particular grade level, She found Khan Academy to be a viable, zero-cost option to supplement her child's curriculum. Anna then realized that other students who were either above or below grade level could benefit and obtained permission from the school to start a Khan Academy morning program. Each Wednesday at 8am, thirty 3rd-5th graders gather to use Khan Academy on iPads. Anna saw a need to help students and thought, “Hey, this is free - why not take advantage of it for our students?”"

msgid "*   **Reimagining the physical classroom and school environment** by removing walls to create an open architecture learning space that accommodates all learning styles, as well as individual workstations for students.  This open architecture allows for the natural flow of ideas among teachers and students.  It is a re-envisioning of what a school looks like, as well as of how a student learns and an educator teaches. The school design is completely centered around accommodating the personalized pathways and learning styles of individual students in order to address what each needs to be successful in college and beyond.

msgid "*   **Removing the restrictions of traditional grade levels** to give students the true freedom to move at their own pace. Students are placed in one of three learning phases - High School Ready, College Ready and Early College - and progress through them, based upon mastery of all the standards of a learning phase. Evaluation of this progress depends on mastery of key skills such as goal setting, time management, study skills, persistence, initiative or self-direction, task completion and responsibility, as well as academic standards."

"> _The 2011-2012 school year was a transformative one for Summit Public Schools. What started out as a blended learning math pilot in our two San Jose schools has fundamentally reshaped the model of our next generation schools, the first two of which will open in the fall of 2013\\. The pilot’s success has influenced how these schools will look and feel, as well as how students will interact with teachers and progress through learning levels._\n"
"> \n"
"> _As an organization, Summit Public Schools is focused on preparing all students not only to attend but to succeed in four-year colleges and beyond. To better meet that goal, we began, in the summer of 2011, to explore ways to accelerate our students’ learning. We were especially interested in addressing academic gaps that dated back to elementary and middle school. Our belief was that technology offered us the ability to create a more personalized learning environment for every individual student, delivering exactly what they need, when they need it and how they need it._"

We designed a blended learning curriculum that could support the mastery of ninth grade math concepts including algebra I and geometry. The model also included daily individualized learning time to ensure students could address any academic gaps. The pilot was a success. Our students achieved significant growth, filling academic gaps with a higher degree of success than we had experienced in our previous ten years of non-blended and personalized efforts."

msgid "At Summit Public Schools, we have time dedicated each day, in addition to our regular courses, for our students to focus on strengthening their mathematical and problem-solving skills, which are crucial for success in college and career.  ‘Summit Solves’ is based on a similar literacy program, Summit Reads, in which students spend 30 minutes each day reading a book of interest to them, at their own pace.  Giving students dedicated time each day to focus on developing their literacy skills and love of reading resulted in strong gains in literacy among our students.  This year, a similar program for math and numeracy skills was launched across the organization."

However, if you just tell your students to \"pair\", you may find that one person does all the work, or they yell at each other, or just don't end up learning from each other.

msgid "This year, I was asked to teach a semester-long high school programming class at Grace International School in Chiang Mai, Thailand. I am a software professional of 30 years, not actually a certified teacher, so I was a little daunted by the prospect of creating and delivering a new curriculum. Fortunately, the KA programming course came to my rescue, giving me a base curriculum to extend."

msgid "I have two programming classes this semester. One has 32 students (10 females, 22 males) and the other has 25 (16 females, 9 males). We meet every day for 40 minutes. Most of the students have computer(s) at home, but may not have access it because it's shared with other family members, so for many of them, this is the only time they have to code. Additionally, since this is an elective class, they may not make much time to code at home because of the demands of their other classes."

msgid "Now, I spend much of my time thinking about how to bring out the power of us all coming together in the same room to learn to program. The students naturally ask each other a lot of questions, bounce ideas off each other, and help each other debug their code. After the assignments are due, the students share their programs with the whole class, and that's a lot of fun. One of the things that we plan to try soon is pair programming, as an additional form of interaction."

As I'd walk around the room, I would pay close attention to their questions, and I would tailor the next lessons I gave around those questions. I keep those lessons to less than 10 minutes at the beginning of each class, to give students a lot of time to work on their programs. I try to teach with programs that they can re-use, adapt, and change as they learn more."

It also allowed the students with more points the opportunity to reinforce their learning by teaching their partners."

When students are begging to do extra homework, there is something very special about the learning content."

I encourage students to use the online documentation ultimately, but some students find it handy to have a physical paper to look at when they're starting to learn, so that they don't have to scroll their code off screen."

msgid "*   [[☃ image 1]][Graph paper](https://s3.amazonaws.com/KA-share/cs/HandoutGraphPaper.pdf): A sheet with two 400*400 grids, for students to sketch their drawings on before transferring the numbers to code. That was inspired by a Programming teacher in the Los Altos School District, who starts off her students with an exercise where they turn code into a drawing on graph paper, before they even know what code is. This is particularly useful for projects like the [Design an Animal](/cs/variables-project-design-an-animal/2321682249) project."

"*   **Talk-throughs**: These are our approach to videos, the way that we teach new concepts. Like Khan’s videos, they’re around 5 minutes long and teach one concept at a time. We present the code on the left, output on the right, and narrate as we write new code, while the output updates live. The student can pause the talk-through at any point, change the code, and see the new output, which is one way we encourage more interactive learning. The talk-throughs have transcripts for deaf students, and are partially translated into Spanish, French, and Portuguese.\n"
"*   **Challenges**: This is how we assess whether students understand the concept we just taught, and there is one challenge for every talk-through. Each challenge starts off with some code and has a series of steps with instructions and hint code for each step. We analyze their code as they type and offer messages to guide them in the right direction, when we see they’ve made a common mistake. When they complete the steps, they earn points and their progress is logged on their activity dashboard.\n"
"*   **Projects**: The projects are our opportunity to give students to be very creative with the concepts they’ve just learnt. They have a general set of guidelines but students can take them in their own direction. For example, after learning how to make shapes, students do “What’s for Dinner?”, drawing their favorite dinner on a plate using the shape commands. Those projects are peer evaluated from fellow online students (if the student is 13+). Many teachers also like to do their own separate evaluation of projects.\n"
"*   **Review articles:** These are a great way for students to review what they've just learned, both immediately after learning it and later on as a refresher."

On average, the talk-throughs are 6 minutes long, the challenges take 5 minutes each to complete, and projects are often completed in 10-40 minutes, depending on how far the student wants to take them. There is thus around 15 hours of curriculum."

"- After taking attendance or any other beginning-of-class procedures, teacher takes class to computer lab or has students open devices in class to spend the period practicing their assigned review topics on Khan Academy.\n"
"- Ensure everyone is signed in correctly at start of session.\n"
"During that time, students work independently to complete their assignments. \n"
"- The teacher may spend time giving small-group instruction to a group of students who the teacher identified for more intensive remediation on that day. Perhaps the teacher has not assigned this small group of students as many review topics on KA  during this round to free those students up to spend time with the teacher.\n"
"- The teacher may also monitor the Activity tab. The Activity tab shows time on task for each student and raises steadily throughout the period, reassuring the teacher that students are on task while the teacher is not monitoring their screens. \n"
"- During the last five minutes of class, the teacher does a quick scan of assignment completion and asks students to complete a reflection on their assignments for the day. A prompt might be: which topic did you find most challenging, and what did you do when you were feeling stuck? "
