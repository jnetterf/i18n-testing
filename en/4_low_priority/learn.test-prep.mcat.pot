An action potential is an extremely quick change in the membrane potential of the neuron that can propagate toward other neurons. It’s like one neuron is telling another neuron “Hey, wake up! We have work to do!” You will soon gain an appreciation for the mechanism of the action potential, which allows for communication between neurons of all flavors in your body- from those responsible for the maintenance of  memory to those functioning in sensation."

When the nephron, the functional unit of the kidney, senses that it is not receiving much blood flow, it knows something is up. So begins a cascade which allows the nephron to reabsorb more fluid from the urine, in attempt to fill up the perceived dip in blood volume. Here you will learn the mechanism of ADH and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system in sustaining this homeostasis. "

If we know the magnitude of the force we provide as well as the mass of the patient and the hospital bed,  we can calculate the acceleration of the patient and his bed using Newton’s Second law (F=ma)."

msgid "Why is it that in America it is acceptable to eat a quarter pound hamburger and guzzle down a large soft drink yet it is weird to eat a grasshopper? The answer is because of our culture. Culture varies across the world and provides rules for a society of people to live by. Here we explore what culture is and how it shapes our human experience."

For instance, one may want to compare the efficacy of a drug in treating diabetics with congestive heart failure compared to diabetics without heart failure - these each form two separate populations of patients.  In this module, you will come to see how different populations interact and change over time. "
