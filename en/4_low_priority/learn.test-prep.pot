"Smarthistory is working to include each of the 250 required works of art. The new test will assess a student’s understanding of the methods used by art historians and familiarity with the cultural context in which a work of art was made and understood. Smarthistory’s art history content is designed to teach these skills and to make the art engaging and accessible (and it’s completely free!). Currently, some 95% of the 250 monuments are discussed in the videos and essays included in this section. We are working to cover the remaining content. New materials are being added regularly. \n"
