The money she spent is a sunk cost, and unless the theater manager is feeling kindly, Selena will not get a refund. But, staying in the movie still means paying an opportunity cost in time. Her choice is whether to spend the next 90 minutes suffering through a cinematic disaster or to do something—anything—else.

msgid "The law of diminishing marginal utility explains why people and societies rarely make all-or-nothing choices. You would probably not say, “My favorite food is ice cream, so I will eat nothing but ice cream from now on.” Even though your favorite food has a high level of utility, if you chose to eat it exclusively, the additional or marginal utility from those last few servings would not be very high. Similarly, most workers would not say: “I enjoy leisure, so I’ll never work.” Instead, workers recognize that even though some leisure is very nice, a combination of all leisure and no income is not so attractive. The budget constraint framework suggests that when people make choices in a world of scarcity, they will use marginal analysis and think about whether they would prefer a little more or a little less."

Second, the slope is defined as the price of whatever is on the horizontal axis in the graph—in this case, bus tickets—divided by the price of whatever is on the vertical axis—in this case, burgers.

Let's suppose a society desires two products: healthcare and education. Just like you might have to chose how many shirts vs. pants you want to buy at the mall, society will have to decide how to allocate its resources to acquire healthcare and education."

Now imagine that some of our society's resources are diverted from healthcare to education, so that the economy is at point B instead of point A. Diverting some resources away from point A to point B causes relatively little reduction in healthcare because the last few marginal dollars going into healthcare services are not producing much additional gain in health. However, putting those marginal dollars into education—which is completely without resources at point A—can produce relatively large gains. For this reason, the shape of the PPF from point A to point B is relatively flat, representing a relatively small drop-off in healthcare and a relatively large gain in education."

msgid "In our example, Brazil has comparative advantage in sugar cane, and the United States has comparative advantage in wheat. Take a look at the PPFs of the two countries. If Brazil devoted all of its resources to producing wheat, it would be producing at point A. If, however, it devoted all of its resources to producing sugar cane instead, it would be producing a much larger amount, at point B. By moving from point A to point B, Brazil would give up a relatively small quantity in wheat production to obtain a large production in sugar cane. The opposite is true for the United States. If the United States moved from point A to point B and produced only sugar cane, its choice would result in a large opportunity cost in terms of sacrificed wheat production. "

The federal minimum wage at the end of 2014 was \\$7.25 per hour, which yields an income for a single person slightly higher than the poverty line. As the cost of living rises over time, Congress periodically raises the federal minimum wage."

msgid "The graph shows an example of a price floor which results in a surplus. The intersection of demand, D, and supply, S, would be at the equilibrium point E0. However, a price floor set at Pf holds the price above E0 and prevents it from falling. The result of the price floor is that the quantity supplied, Qs, exceeds the quantity demanded, Qd. There is excess supply, also called a surplus."

In 1970, the Environmental Protection Agency was created to oversee all environmental laws. In the same year, the Clean Air Act was enacted to address air pollution. Just two years later, in 1972, Congress passed and the president signed the far-reaching Clean Water Act. These command-and-control environmental laws, and their amendments and updates, have been largely responsible for cleaner air and water in the United States in recent decades. However, economists have pointed out three difficulties with command-and-control environmental regulation."

This means that command-and-control regulation draws no distinctions between firms that would find it easy and inexpensive to meet the pollution standard—or to reduce pollution even further—and firms that might find it difficult and costly to meet the standard. Firms have no reason to rethink their production methods in fundamental ways that might reduce pollution even more and at lower cost."

Existing firms often argue—and lobby—that stricter environmental standards should not apply to them, only to new firms that wish to start production. Consequently, real-world environmental laws are full of fine print, loopholes, and exceptions."

msgid "Saying that overall benefits of environmental regulation have exceeded costs in the past, however, is very different from saying that every environmental regulation makes sense. For example, studies suggest that when breaking down emission reductions by type of contaminants, the benefits of air pollution control outweigh the costs primarily for particulates and lead. When looking at other air pollutants, the costs of reducing them may be comparable to or greater than the benefits. "

Does it mean flying in a helicopter to shoot anesthetic darts at African wildlife? Or a little of both? The definition may be fuzzy, but tourists who hope to appreciate the ecology of their destination—ecotourists—are the impetus for a large and growing business. The International Ecotourism Society estimates that international tourists interested in seeing nature or wildlife will take 1.56 billion trips by 2020."

When there is market failure, the private market fails to achieve efficient output because either firms do not account for all costs incurred in the production of output and/or consumers do not account for all benefits obtained, in the case of a positive externality. In the case of pollution, at the market output, social costs of production exceed social benefits to consumers, and the market produces too much of the product."

msgid "In a market with no anti-pollution restrictions, firms can dispose of certain wastes at no cost. Now imagine that firms that produce refrigerators must factor in these *external costs* of pollution—that is, the firms have to consider not only the costs of labor and materials needed to make a refrigerator but also the broader costs to society from pollution. If the firm is required to pay \\$100 for the additional external costs of pollution each time it produces a refrigerator, production becomes more costly and the entire supply curve shifts up by \\$100."

For example, the government might pay landowners who provide and maintain suitable habitats for endangered species or who restrict the use of their land to protect an endangered species. Again, an environmental law built on incentives and flexibility offers greater promise than a command-and-control approach, which tries to oversee millions of acres of privately owned land."

The revised law sought to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions from electric power plants to half of the 1980 levels out of concern that sulfur dioxide was causing acid rain, which harms forests as well as buildings. In this case, the marketable permits the federal government issued were free to electricity-generating plants across the country, especially those that were burning coal—which produces sulfur dioxide. These permits were of the “shrinkable” type; that is, the amount of pollution allowed by a given permit declined with time."

Does the farmer have a property right not to have a field burned? Does the railroad have a property right to run its own trains on its own tracks? If neither party has a property right, then the two sides may squabble endlessly, nothing will be done, and sparks will continue to set the field aflame. However, if either the farmer or the railroad has a well-defined legal responsibility, then that party will seek out and pay for the least costly method of reducing the risk that sparks will hit the field. The property right determines whether the farmer or the railroad pays the bills."

msgid "For an example of a pollution charge at the household level, let's consider two ways of charging for garbage collection. One method is to have a flat fee per household, no matter how much garbage a household produces. An alternative approach is to have several levels of fees, depending on how much garbage the household produces and to offer lower or free charges for recyclable materials. As of 2006, the US Environmental Protection Agency had recorded over 7,000 communities that have implemented pay-as-you-throw programs. When people have a financial incentive to put out less garbage and to increase recycling, they find ways of doing so."

The other rows of the table show the cost of reducing garbage produced by the first 5 tons, the second 5 tons, and so on. First, calculate the cost of requiring each firm to reduce the weight of its garbage by one-fourth.

msgid "To see how marketable permits can work to reduce pollution, consider the four firms listed in the table below. The table shows current emissions of lead from each firm. At the start of the marketable permit program, each firm receives permits to allow this level of pollution. However, these permits are shrinkable, and next year the permits allow the firms to emit only half as much pollution. "

To understand the defining characteristics of a public good, first consider an ordinary private good, like a piece of pizza. A piece of pizza can be bought and sold fairly easily because it is a separate and identifiable item. However, public goods are not separate and identifiable in this way."

The first characteristic, that a public good is *nonexcludable*, means that it is costly or impossible to exclude someone from using the good. If Larry buys a private good like a piece of pizza, then he can exclude others, like Lorna, from eating that pizza. However, if national defense is being provided, then it includes everyone. Even if you strongly disagree with America’s defense policies or with the level of defense spending, the national defense still protects you. You cannot choose to be unprotected, and national defense cannot protect everyone else and exclude you."

In a more recent development, satellite radio companies, such as SirusXM, charge a regular subscription fee for streaming music without commercials.

These waters are so shallow, and so clear, that a single diver may harvest many conch in a single day. Not only is conch meat a local delicacy and an important part of the local diet, but the large ornate shells are used in art and can be crafted into musical instruments. Because almost anyone with a small boat, snorkel, and mask can participate in the conch harvest, it is essentially nonexcludable. At the same time, fishing for conch is rivalrous; once a diver catches one conch it cannot be caught by another diver."

Public health officials taught hygienic practices to mothers in the early 1900s and encouraged less smoking in the late 1900s. Many public sanitation systems and storm sewers were funded by government because they have the key traits of public goods. In the 20th century, many medical discoveries came out of government- or university-funded research. Patents and intellectual property rights provided an additional incentive for private inventors. The reason for requiring immunizations, phrased in economic terms, is that it prevents spillovers of illness to others—as well as helping the person immunized."

When the population of a species drops to critically low numbers, governments have even banned the harvest until biologists determine that the population has returned to sustainable levels. In fact, such is the case with the conch, the harvesting of which has been effectively banned in the United States since 1986."

msgid "Almost universally, economists have found that the answer to this question is a clear yes. For example, several studies of the return to education in the United States estimate that the rate of return to a college education is approximately 10%. The table below—showing data from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics’ *Usual Weekly Earnings of Wage and Salary Workers, Third Quarter 2014*—demonstrates that median weekly earnings are higher for workers who have completed more education. While these rates of return will beat equivalent investments in Treasury bonds or savings accounts, the estimated returns to education go primarily to the individual worker, so these returns are *private rates of return* to education."

One policy would be to provide a subsidy, like a voucher, to any citizen who wishes to get vaccinated. This voucher would act as income that could be used to purchase only a flu shot and—if the voucher were exactly equal to the per-unit spillover benefits—would increase market equilibrium to a quantity of $\\text{QSocial}$ and a price of $\\text{PSocial}$ where MSB equals MSC. Suppliers of the flu shots would receive payment of $\\text{PSocial}$ per vaccination, while consumers of flu shots would redeem the voucher and only pay a price of $\\text{PSubsidy}$.

When we add the spillover benefits to the marginal private benefit of flu shots, the marginal social benefit, or MSB, of flu shots is given by $\\text{DSocial}$. Because the MPB is greater than the MSB, we see that the socially optimal level of flu shots is greater than the market quantity—$\\text{QSocial}$ exceeds $\\text{QMarket}$.

msgid "Eli Whitney invented the cotton gin, but then southern cotton planters built their own seed-separating devices with just a few minor changes from Whitney’s design. When Whitney sued, he found that the courts in southern states would not uphold his patent rights. Thomas Edison still holds the record for most patents granted to an individual. His first invention was an automatic vote counter, but despite the social benefits, he could not find a government that wanted to buy it. Gordon Gould came up with the idea behind the laser in 1957. He put off applying for a patent and—by the time he did apply—other scientists had laser inventions of their own. A lengthy legal battle resulted in which Gould spent \\$100,000 on lawyers before he eventually received a patent for the laser in 1977. Compared to the enormous social benefits of the laser, Gould received relatively little financial reward. In 1936, Turing delivered a paper titled, \"On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem,\" in which he presented the notion of a universal machine—later called the Universal Turing Machine and then the Turing machine—capable of computing anything that is computable. The central concept of the modern computer was based on Turing’s paper."

These bands can, if they wish, keep raising the price of tickets. Some of the most popular bands could actually make more revenue by setting prices so high that the arena is not filled—but those who buy the tickets would have to pay very high prices. However, bands sometimes choose to sell tickets for less than the absolute maximum they might be able to charge, often in the hope that fans will feel happier and spend more on recordings, t-shirts, and other paraphernalia."

msgid "Elasticity also reveals whether firms can pass higher costs that they incur on to consumers. Addictive substances tend to fall into this category. For example, the demand for cigarettes is relatively inelastic among regular smokers who are somewhat addicted. Economic research suggests that increasing the price of cigarettes by 10% leads to about a 3% reduction in the quantity of cigarettes smoked by adults, so the elasticity of demand for cigarettes is 0.3. If society increases taxes on companies that make cigarettes, the result will be—as shown in diagram A below on the left—that the supply curve shifts from $\\text{S0}$ to $\\text{S1}$. However, as the equilibrium moves from $\\text{E0}$ to $\\text{E1}$, these taxes are mainly passed along to consumers in the form of higher prices. These higher prices on cigarettes will raise tax revenue for the government, but they will not affect the quantity of smoking much."

However, if demand for cigarettes was more elastic—as shown in diagram B, below on the right—then an increase in taxes that shifts supply from $\\text{S0}$ to $\\text{S1}$ and equilibrium from $\\text{E0}$ to $\\text{E1}$ would reduce the quantity of cigarettes smoked substantially.

The situation shown in diagram A, with extremely inelastic demand, means that a new invention may cause the price to drop dramatically while quantity changes little. As a result, the new production technology can lead to a drop in the revenue that firms earn from sales of aspirin. However, if strong competition exists between producers of aspirin, each producer may have little choice but to search for and implement any breakthrough that allows it to reduce production costs. After all, if one firm decides not to implement such a cost-saving technology, it can be driven out of business by other firms that do."

In this case, a technological breakthrough that shifts supply to the right—from $\\text{S0}$ to $\\text{S1}$ so that the equilibrium shifts from $\\text{E0}$ to $\\text{E1}$—creates a substantially lower price for the product with relatively little impact on the quantity sold. In diagram B on the right, the demand curve is drawn as highly elastic. In this case, the technological breakthrough leads to a much greater quantity being sold in the market at very close to the original price. Consumers benefit more, in general, when the demand curve is more inelastic because the shift in the supply results in a much lower price for consumers."

msgid "The reason for these price bounces lies in a combination of inelastic demand and shifts in supply. The elasticity of coffee demand is only about 0.3; in other words, a 10% rise in the price of coffee leads to a decline of about 3% in the quantity of coffee consumed. When a major frost hit the Brazilian coffee crop in 1994, coffee supply shifted to the left with an inelastic demand curve, leading to much higher prices. Conversely, when Vietnam entered the world coffee market as a major producer in the late 1990s, the supply curve shifted out to the right. With a highly inelastic demand curve, coffee prices fell dramatically. You can see this phenomenon graphically in diagram A, above on the left."

msgid "In diagram A, above on the left, the supply is inelastic and the demand is elastic—as it was in the beachfront hotels example. While consumers may have other vacation choices, sellers can’t easily move their businesses. By introducing a tax, the government essentially creates a wedge between the price paid by consumers, $\\text{Pc}$, and the price received by producers, $\\text{Pp}$. In other words, of the total price paid by consumers, part is retained by the sellers and part is paid to the government in the form of a tax. The distance between $\\text{Pc}$ and $\\text{Pp}$ is the tax rate. The new market price is $\\text{Pc}$, but sellers receive only $\\text{Pp}$ per unit sold since they pay $\\text{Pc}-\\text{Pp}$ to the government. Since a tax can be viewed as raising the costs of production, this could also be represented by a leftward shift of the supply curve. The new supply curve would intercept the demand at the new quantity $\\text{Qt}$. For simplicity, the diagram above omits the shift in the supply curve."

This was an increase of 11.4 million subscribers since the price increase—an average per quarter growth of about 1.6 million.

msgid "Similarly, elasticity of supply or the supply elasticity is sometimes called—to avoid any possibility of confusion—the price elasticity of supply or “the elasticity of supply with respect to price”. But in whatever context elasticity is invoked, the idea always refers to percentage change in one variable—almost always a price or money variable—and how it causes a percentage change in another variable—typically a quantity variable of some kind."

msgid "In 1983, for example, US petroleum consumption was 15.3 million barrels a day, which was lower than in 1973 or 1975. US petroleum consumption was down even though the US economy was about one-fourth larger in 1983 than it had been in 1973. The primary reason for the lower quantity was that higher energy prices spurred conservation efforts, and after a decade of home insulation, more fuel-efficient cars, more efficient appliances and machinery, and other fuel-conserving choices, the demand curve for energy had become more elastic."

msgid "Indeed, in most markets for goods and services, prices bounce up and down more than quantities in the short run, but quantities often move more than prices in the long run. The underlying reason for this pattern is that supply and demand are often inelastic in the short run, so that shifts in either demand or supply can cause a relatively greater change in prices. But—since supply and demand are more elastic in the long run—the long-run movements in prices are more muted and quantity adjusts more easily."

Maybe you can carpool to work occasionally or adjust your home thermostat by a few degrees if the cost of energy rises, but that is about all you can do. In the long run, however, you can purchase a car that gets more miles to the gallon, choose a job that is closer to where you live, buy more energy-efficient home appliances, or install more insulation in your home. As a result, the elasticity of demand for energy is somewhat inelastic in the short run but much more elastic in the long run."

In 1973, the price of crude oil was \\$12 per barrel and total consumption in the US economy was 17 million barrels per day. That year, the nations who were members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, OPEC, cut off oil exports to the United States for six months because the Arab members of OPEC disagreed with US support for Israel. OPEC did not bring exports back to their earlier levels until 1975—a policy that can be interpreted as a shift of the supply curve to the left in the US petroleum market. "

msgid "*Constant unitary elasticity*, in either a supply or demand curve, occurs when a price change of 1% results in a quantity change of 1%. The diagram below shows a demand curve with constant unit elasticity. As we move down the demand curve from $\\text{A}$ to $\\text{B}$, the price falls by 33%, and quantity demanded rises by 33%. As you move from $\\text{B}$ to $\\text{C}$, the price falls by 25%, and the quantity demanded rises by 25%. As you move from $\\text{C}$ to $\\text{D}$, the price falls by 16%, and the quantity rises by 16%. Notice that in absolute value, the declines in price as you step down the demand curve are not identical. Instead, the price falls by \\$3 from $\\text{A}$ to $\\text{B}$, by a smaller amount of \\$1.50 from $\\text{B}$ to $\\text{C}$, and by a still smaller amount of \\$0.75 from $\\text{C}$ to $\\text{D}$.

msgid "Recall that the elasticity between point $\\text{A}$ point $\\text{B}$ was 0.45. So, demand was inelastic between points $\\text{A}$ and $\\text{B}$ and elastic between points $\\text{G}$ and $\\text{H}$. This shows us that price elasticity of demand changes at different points along a straight-line demand curve."

msgid "So, at one end of the demand curve, where we have a large percentage change in quantity demanded over a small percentage change in price, the elasticity value would be high, or demand would be relatively elastic. Even with the same change in the price and the same change in the quantity demanded, at the other end of the demand curve the quantity is much higher, and the price is much lower, so the percentage change in quantity demanded is smaller and the percentage change in price is much higher. That means at the bottom of the curve we have a small numerator over a large denominator, so the elasticity measure would be much lower, or inelastic."

msgid "A doubling of the cost of producing the pipe allows the chemical firm to process four times as much material. This pattern is a major reason for economies of scale in chemical production, which uses a large quantity of pipes. Of course, economies of scale in a chemical plant are more complex than this simple calculation suggests, but the chemical engineers who design these plants have long used what they call the six-tenths rule—a rule of thumb which holds that increasing the quantity produced in a chemical plant by a certain percentage will increase total cost by only six-tenths as much."

msgid "A great example of economies of scale is the chemical industry. Chemical plants have a lot of pipes. The cost of the materials for producing a pipe is related to the circumference of the pipe and its length. However, the volume of chemicals that can flow through a pipe is determined by the cross-section area of the pipe. The table below shows that a pipe which uses twice as much material to make—as shown by the circumference of the pipe doubling—can actually carry four times the volume of chemicals because the cross-section area of the pipe rises by a factor of four—as you can see in the area column."

A firm can hire workers to push supplies around a factory on rolling carts, it can invest in motorized vehicles, or it can invest in robots that carry materials without a driver.

msgid "The diagram below illustrates the idea of economies of scale; it shows the average cost of producing an alarm clock falling as the quantity of output rises. For a small-sized factory like $\\text{S}$—with an output level of 1,000—the average cost of production is \\$12 per alarm clock. For a medium-sized factory like $\\text{M}$—with an output level of 2,000—the average cost of production falls to \\$8 per alarm clock. For a large factory like $\\text{L}$—with an output of 5,000—the average cost of production declines still further to \\$4 per alarm clock."

msgid "To understand the reason behind this pattern, consider that a one-man barber shop is a very busy operation. The single barber needs to do everything—say hello to people entering, answer the phone, cut hair, sweep up, and run the cash register. A second barber reduces the level of disruption from jumping back and forth between these tasks and allows a greater division of labor and specialization. The result can be greater increasing marginal returns. However, as other barbers are added, the advantage of each additional barber is less since the specialization of labor can only go so far. The addition of a sixth or seventh or eighth barber just to greet people at the door will have less impact than the second one did. "

For market structures such as monopoly, monopolistic competition, and oligopoly—which are more frequently observed in the real world than perfect competition—firms will not always produce at the minimum of average cost, nor will they always set price equal to marginal cost. Thus, these other competitive situations will not produce productive and allocative efficiency."

msgid "No perfectly competitive firm acting alone can affect the market price. However, the combination of many firms entering or exiting the market will affect overall supply in the market. In turn, a shift in supply for the market as a whole will affect the market price. Entry and exit to and from the market are the driving forces behind a process that—in the long run—pushes the price down to minimum average total costs so that all firms are earning a zero profit."

msgid "This will temporarily make the market price rise above the average cost curve, and therefore, the existing firms in the market will now be earning economic profits. However, these economic profits attract other firms to enter the market. Entry of many new firms causes the market supply curve to shift to the right. As the supply curve shifts to the right, the market price starts decreasing, causing economic profits to fall for new and existing firms. As long as there are still profits in the market, entry will continue to shift supply to the right. This shift will stop whenever the market price is driven down to the zero-profit level, where no firm is earning economic profits."

In that situation, the best the firm could do would be to suffer losses.

msgid "A perfectly competitive firm is known as a *price taker* because the pressure of competing firms forces them to accept the prevailing equilibrium price in the market. If a firm in a perfectly competitive market raises the price of its product by so much as a penny, it will lose all of its sales to competitors. When a wheat grower wants to know what the going price of wheat is, they have to go to the computer or listen to the radio to check. The market price is determined solely by supply and demand in the entire market and not by the individual farmer. Also, a perfectly competitive firm must be a very small player in the overall market so that it can increase or decrease output without noticeably affecting the overall quantity supplied and price in the market."

In the short run, the perfectly competitive firm will seek the quantity of output where profits are highest or—if profits are not possible—where losses are lowest. In this example, the short run refers to a situation in which firms are producing with one fixed input and incur fixed costs of production. In the real world, firms can have many fixed inputs."

Demand is based on needs and wants—a consumer may be able to differentiate between a need and a want, but from an economist’s perspective they are the same thing. Demand is also based on ability to pay. If you cannot pay, you have no effective demand."

When economists talk about demand, they mean the relationship between a range of prices and the quantities demanded at those prices, as illustrated by a demand curve or a demand schedule. When economists talk about quantity demanded, they mean only a certain point on the demand curve or one quantity on the demand schedule. In short, demand refers to the curve, and quantity demanded refers to a specific point on the curve."

msgid "What a buyer pays for a unit of the specific good or service is called **price**. The total number of units purchased at that price is called the **quantity demanded**. A rise in price of a good or service almost always decreases the quantity demanded of that good or service. Conversely, a fall in price will increase the quantity demanded. When the price of a gallon of gasoline goes up, for example, people look for ways to reduce their consumption by combining several errands, commuting by carpool or mass transit, or taking weekend or vacation trips closer to home. Economists call this inverse relationship between price and quantity demanded the *law of demand*. The law of demand assumes that all other variables that affect demand are held constant."

Economists call this assumption ceteris paribus, a Latin phrase meaning “other things being equal”. If all else is not held equal, then the laws of supply and demand will not necessarily hold.

A **substitute** is a good or service that can be used in place of another good or service. As electronic resources, like this one, become more available, you would expect to see a decrease in demand for traditional printed books. A lower price for a substitute decreases demand for the other product. For example, in recent years as the price of tablet computers has fallen, the quantity demanded has increased because of the law of demand. Since people are purchasing tablets, there has been a decrease in demand for laptops, which can be shown graphically as a leftward shift in the demand curve for laptops. A higher price for a substitute good has the reverse effect."

msgid "We defined demand as the amount of some product a consumer is *willing* and *able* to purchase at each price. That suggests at least two factors in addition to price that affect demand. Willingness to purchase suggests a desire, based on what economists call tastes and preferences. If you neither need nor want something, you will not buy it. Ability to purchase suggests that income is important. Professors are usually able to afford better housing and transportation than students because they have more income. Prices of related goods can affect demand also. If you need a new car, the price of a Honda may affect your demand for a Ford. Finally, the size or composition of the population can affect demand. The more children a family has, the greater their demand for clothing. The more driving-age children a family has, the greater their demand for car insurance, and the less for diapers and baby formula."

msgid "While it is clear that the price of a good affects the quantity demanded, it is also true that expectations about the future price—or expectations about tastes and preferences, income, and so on—can affect demand. For example, if people hear that a hurricane is coming, they may rush to the store to buy flashlight batteries and bottled water. If people learn that the price of a good like coffee is likely to rise in the future, they may head for the store to stock up on coffee now. These changes in demand are shown as shifts in the curve. Therefore, a shift in demand happens when a change in some economic factor other than price causes a different quantity to be demanded at every price."

The answer lies in the ***ceteris paribus***—Latin for \"other things equal\"—assumption. We must look at how each economic event affects each market, one event at a time, holding all else constant. Then, we combine the analyses to see the net effect."

msgid "It's also important to keep in mind that economic events that affect equilibrium price and quantity may seem to cause immediate change when examining them using the four-step analysis. As a practical matter, however, prices and quantities often do not zoom straight to equilibrium. More realistically, when an economic event causes demand or supply to shift, prices and quantities set off in the general direction of equilibrium. Indeed, even as they are moving toward one new equilibrium, prices are often then pushed by another change in demand or supply toward another equilibrium."

msgid "When economists talk about *supply*, they mean the amount of some good or service a producer is willing to supply at each price. Price is what the producer receives for selling *one unit of a good or service*. A rise in price almost always leads to an increase in the *quantity supplied* of that good or service, while a fall in price will decrease the quantity supplied. When the price of gasoline rises, for example, it encourages profit-seeking firms to take several actions: expand exploration for oil reserves, drill for more oil, invest in more pipelines and oil tankers to bring the oil to plants where it can be refined into gasoline, build new oil refineries, purchase additional pipelines and trucks to ship the gasoline to gas stations, and open more gas stations or keep existing gas stations open longer hours. Economists call this positive relationship between price and quantity supplied—that a higher price leads to a higher quantity supplied and a lower price leads to a lower quantity supplied—*the law of supply*. The law of supply assumes that all other variables that affect supply are held constant."

msgid "In 2014, the Manchurian Plain in Northeastern China—which produces most of the country's wheat, corn, and soybeans—experienced its most severe drought in 50 years. A drought decreases the supply of agricultural products, which means that at any given price, a lower quantity will be supplied. Conversely, especially good weather would shift the supply curve to the right."

msgid "When a firm discovers a new technology that allows it to produce at a lower cost, the supply curve will shift to the right as well. For instance, in the 1960s, a major scientific effort nicknamed the Green Revolution focused on breeding improved seeds for basic crops like wheat and rice. By the early 1990s, more than two-thirds of the wheat and rice in low-income countries around the world was grown with these Green Revolution seeds—and the harvest was twice as high per acre. A technological improvement that reduces costs of production will shift supply to the right, causing a greater quantity to be produced at any given price."

msgid "Government policies can affect the cost of production and the supply curve through taxes, regulations, and subsidies. For example, the U.S. government imposes a tax on alcoholic beverages that collects about $8 billion per year from producers. Taxes are treated as costs by businesses. Higher costs decrease supply for the reasons discussed above. Another example of policy that can affect cost is the wide array of government regulations that require firms to spend money to provide a cleaner environment or a safer workplace; complying with regulations increases costs."
