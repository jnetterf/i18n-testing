[[☃ explanation 1]] For example, when a ball is thrown up in the air, velocity is initially upward. Since gravity pulls the object toward the earth with a constant acceleration $g$, the magnitude of velocity decreases as the ball approaches maximum height, then increases as the ball falls back toward the earth (see Figure 1)."
