"Each infectious disease has a unique $R_0$ value which represents the average number of people that a single sick person will infect (assuming that nobody has been vaccinated) while they are infectious. In some diseases, a single patient can spread the disease for days (e.g. Ebola) and in others, for decades (e.g. HIV). A larger $R_0$ value means that it is harder to control an epidemic, because each sick person can spread the disease to more people. For example, polio has an $R_0$ value of 6, which means one sick person will infect 6 people (on average). Fortunately, public health interventions like isolating sick individuals, wearing protective clothing (e.g. gloves, gowns, face shield, and mask) when needed, and vaccinating healthy individuals can help to prevent transmission of even the most contagious diseases! \n"

msgid "This patient has mild respiratory acidosis which can be normal for a patient with COPD. No action is needed. A patient may only be mildly hypoxic in the early stages of COPD, but as the disease progresses, increasing hypoxia stimulates hyperventilation and respiratory alkalosis. In later stages, chronic $\\text{CO}_2$ retention and respiratory acidosis occurs. Also remember that the administration of oxygen to a patient with COPD can cause a depression in the respiratory drive."
