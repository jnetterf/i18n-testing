msgid "For most of the agrarian era, the four world zones operated independently of each other with little or no knowledge of what was going on in the other zones. The world, in effect, was divided into four unconnected regions, none of which was really interested in the others. With the improved transportation and communication technologies developed 500 years ago, humans acquired the means for connecting these formerly independent zones. After 1492, for example, the Americas and Afro-Eurasia were put in regular contact, and the Columbian Exchange saw the transfer of people, ideas, animals, plants, and diseases between these two once separate world zones. Exchanges like these fueled social, political, economic, and intellectual innovation. Within a few hundred years, this more fully connected world saw dramatic acceleration in innovation and population growth, which ushered in the Modern Revolution. "

msgid "The Modern Revolution created the world we live in today. This world is very different from the world of 500 or 1,000 years ago, let alone 10,000 or 100,000 years ago. The connection of the four world zones allowed for the creation of a global network of exchange. Though this network was not built overnight, it emerged fairly quickly, and it increased the potential connections and diversity of connections for many members of the network. The result was an acceleration of both collective learning and innovation. Commerce was an important driver of change in this global network. Because commerce began to take on greater significance for many societies, a number of important thinkers began to ask questions about the nature of the exchange of goods, the nature of productivity and efficiency, and the interests of the individual and the state in business. All of this new inquiry gave birth to the discipline of economics. These economic thinkers, like the thinkers in any discipline, shared a set of concerns and questions but often came up with very different answers to those questions. The articulation of the ideas of capitalism and communism were the most influential economic ideas generated in the course of the Modern Revolution.  "

msgid "For most of the past 10,000 years or so, the biosphere has been a fairly stable and predictable place. Whether you look at temperature, types of vegetation, soils, or sea level, the basic characteristics of the biosphere have remained about the same, having shown only moderate variation at any point within most of that time frame. That type of consistency is what prompted geologists to label the last 10,000 years of geological history as the Holocene Epoch; an epoch that was ushered in at the end of the last ice age. But there are now a number of scientists who view the data from the last 250 years and conclude that the biosphere is showing fundamentally different characteristics from the previous 10,000 years. The rise of carbon dioxide levels, glacial melting, and the shrinking of tropical rainforests are just some of the factors that they cite as evidence that the biosphere has entered a new epoch. Because so much of the change they have identified seems to derive from human activity, these scientists propose that this new epoch be called the Anthropocene to reflect the tremendous impact that humans now exert in the biosphere.

msgid "The mysterious pyramids of Ancient Egypt, the Great Wall of China, and the beauty of Machu Picchu (an old Incan city in Peru) are all impressive remnants left behind from some of the world’s ancient agrarian civilizations. But not every civilization has left behind such noticeable clues. In fact, many artifacts from agrarian civilizations fade away with time. But the clues that remain become important windows to the past. Researchers in a variety of disciplines such as history and archaeology use both written record and historical artifacts to pose, analyze, and answer questions about the past. As you will see, written record is of particular importance. Unlike other species, writing gives us the ability to preserve and pass on large amounts of information from one generation to the next. With this ability comes incredible power.\n"

msgid "The invention of farming led to dramatic changes in the way humans got their food. By domesticating plants and animals, people could settle in one place. Because domestication gave people more control over the plants and animals in an area, human groups could grow bigger and denser. As these populations grew and turned into cities, states, and empires, greater opportunities for collective learning evolved but so did the types of challenges human communities had to face. Population growth, specialization of labor, and the emergence of rulers and social hierarchies all paved the way for increased collective learning, but they also created some complex problems and relationships that we are still struggling to resolve today."

msgid "All living things need energy to survive. For a long time, humans met their energy needs almost exclusively by eating the food they foraged in their local environment. In other words, humans were completely dependent on the plants and animals that nature provided. The invention of farming about 12,000 years ago gave humans access to vast new food and energy resources, which helped to dramatically transform the way humans lived. Among other things, farming made possible dramatic population growth, and it allowed humans to settle in larger, denser communities than a foraging lifestyle could support. These larger and denser communities eventually led to the development of cities and civilizations, which accelerated collective learning and innovation. "

Over time, these zones slowly became more connected as networks of communication and exchange expanded. While innovations did occur throughout this era, such as irrigation, iron plows, and fast-ripening rice, none of these innovations were able to sustain long-term population growth, which limited expansion. Each innovation led to immediate growth, but once populations had grown beyond a certain point, they fell. These cycles of rise and fall in population, called Malthusian cycles, characterized the agrarian era. Humans would not break out of these cycles until the world zones became more connected and rates of innovation were capable of sustaining growth over much longer periods of time."

The voyages of Christopher Columbus extended this exchange from Afro-Eurasia to the Americas, which saw a massive movement of ideas, people, diseases, plants, and animals between the two hemispheres. The results of these exchanges were dramatic. Potatoes and corn, first cultivated in the Americas, quickly became crucial in the diets of people across Eurasia. Horses and cattle, unknown in the New World in 1492, quickly took on crucial roles in many societies in the Americas. The linking of the different world zones in this period and the exchanges that this linking made possible, transformed the lifeways of the people and civilizations involved – and laid the foundation for modern exchange routes and the global balance of power."

msgid "Early humans had pretty small social networks. At most, they probably met only a couple hundred people who probably all lived very similar lives to their own. As people started farming, these networks got larger. People were increasingly specialized in their work and trade. Populations in cities got larger.

msgid "Big History tells the story of the Universe from the Big Bang to the present. It would be impossible for any history course to cover everything related to its subject matter, and this challenge is particularly great in Big History because of the scales of time and size involved. Big History deals with this challenge by focusing on the eight turning points, or thresholds, over the course of the 13.8 billion-year story. At each of these thresholds, the Universe became more complex, and things appeared with significant new emergent properties. In this lesson, you’ll review what you’ve learned about this story, which will put you in the perfect position to think about the future of Big History in subsequent lessons in this unit. "

msgid "Historians typically focus on the past, asking questions like: What happened in the past? Why did it happen? What lessons can be drawn from these events? Studying the past is possible because there is lots of interesting evidence left behind for scholars of many disciplines—not just historians—to look at. Physicists, for example, can look at the abundance of hydrogen and helium in the Universe today and draw conclusions about the early history of the Universe. Geologists can look at the distribution of plants and animals and rock formations on the Earth today and draw conclusions about the how the configuration of the Earth’s continents has changed over time. Each discipline has its own questions and evidence and is interested in investigating change over time. Historians don’t typically predict the future, but given the number of trends you’ve studied in this course, it seems appropriate to give some thought to what the future might be like."

msgid "As you learned in Unit 5, the biosphere is not static. The biosphere changes as a result of astronomical, geological, and biological influences. The dinosaurs, for example, became extinct as a result of an astronomical event—the effects of an asteroid impact on Earth. Every species impacts the biosphere, though the extent of that impact can vary dramatically. The impact of humans has changed over time. The impact of foragers was not dramatic, but these early humans did have the ability to destroy flora and fauna and cause fires in different parts of the Earth. Agriculture, and later the modern revolution, significantly increased the impact of humans on the biosphere. The acceleration of the last 100 years has seen an acceleration of these human impacts on the biosphere. What are the most significant of these impacts and what should humans be doing about them? "

msgid "With the appearance of the first planets, the Universe became much more complex. Planets, which formed from clouds of chemicals created during the death of stars, are more chemically diverse than the stars from which they came. Planets also differ from stars because they don’t generate huge amounts of energy at their centers. As a result, their surface temperatures are much cooler. This combination of diverse chemical ingredients and less violent conditions enabled planets to become the setting for life. When life emerged on Earth, it had characteristics that made it very different from nonliving things. Many people will tell you they “know” the difference between living and nonliving things. However, biologists – the experts – have struggled to agree on a single definition of life, even though many of the proposed definitions share similarities. In this lesson, we’ll focus on understanding the characteristics all living things share. "

msgid "Before 1995, most people believed that the only planets in the Universe were found in our Solar System. Since 1995, hundreds of “exoplanets,” or planets outside of our Solar System, have been discovered orbiting other stars. The Earth and our Solar System are not as unique as they were once thought to be. Planet formation is now considered to be very common in the Universe, and planets can form in the wake of the formation of any star. Star formation begins in giant gas clouds, and probably 99.9 percent of the material in these clouds goes into making the star. Only about 0.1 percent of the material in the original gas cloud is left for planet formation. This leftover material orbits the star and various forces cause the materials to begin crashing into one another. Over time, this process leads to the formation of very large objects—what we know as planets. Sometimes rocky like our Earth, sometimes gassy like Jupiter, these planets gather mass as other floating debris crashes onto their surfaces. In the early days of our Solar System, the Earth was constantly bombarded with floating debris. Over time, things settled down and the Earth cooled, making it the perfect place for life to form."

In this lesson, you will learn that the surface of the Earth changes as well. The high temperatures that caused the differentiation of the Earth’s layers continue even today. In a process known as plate tectonics, the heat and movement of the mantle floating under the Earth’s crust drive the movement of the Earth’s crust over its surface. The slow shifting of these tectonic plates explains the shape of our continents as well as mountain ranges and traumatic events like earthquakes."

msgid "Scientists estimate that the Earth formed about 4.6 billion years ago. The Earth that we know today, the relatively peaceful home of myriad forms of life, didn’t appear overnight. Rather, it took billions of years to slowly evolve into its current form. The process of accretion that led to the formation of the Earth was a violent one, and it produced an Earth that was only a little less violent and hostile. For a few hundred million years, the early Earth was characterized by high temperatures, toxic gases, high levels of radiation, and ongoing high-impact collisions. Over time, these conditions improved and the Earth took on its distinctive structure with differentiated layers of core, mantle, crust, and atmosphere. This distinctive structure has important consequences: First, it helps explain why the surface of the Earth changes over time; and second, it helps explain why the Earth evolved into a suitable setting for living things.

Neon, oxygen, silicon, and iron were also created during the lives of stars. However, once these stars started running out of fuel is when things really got interesting. It’s in the massive explosions that resulted from certain stars running out of fuel that all of the elements of the periodic table were created. Without the death of stars, our world would not exist today. "

msgid "By 200 million years after the Big Bang, the Universe had become a very dark and cold place. Then things started to change. First, galaxies and nebulae formed. These were the earliest structures in the Universe. Then stars – “hot spots” of light and energy – emerged from these clouds of dust and gas. Why did they form and how did they change everything? Stars, the first complex, stable entities in the Universe, have the capacity to generate energy for millions, even billions of years. The first stars, which passed through their entire life cycles relatively quickly, produced many of the chemical elements of the periodic table. In this unit, you’ll learn how stars first formed and how the lives and deaths of stars provided the chemical diversity necessary for even more complex things."

One way of dealing with this challenge is by using different scales so that each topic can be studied from the appropriate perspective. In this lesson, you’ll watch a video on scale, and then take part in an activity that will get you out of your chair. By the time you’ve seen the video and finished the activity, you’ll have a good sense of how scale can affect the way we view things."

Each perspective represents one or more areas of study (we call these disciplines), and each area of study strives to answer a completely different set of questions about ourselves, our planet, and the Universe. No one discipline can know all there is to know about absolutely everything. It would be impossible to think of all the questions to ask, let alone have all the answers. Usually, if we look at any single object or event from the points of view of multiple areas of expertise, we can put together a rich understanding that goes far beyond a one-discipline approach."
