msgid "Throughout this section of the resource, we focus on activities you can complete to wrap up the college application process.  This timeline-view gives you a guideline as to when in your high school career each activity is particularly relevant.  Certain activities have a single checkmark (for instance, under winter of 11th grade year), typically indicating a one-time or short-term endeavor.  Other activities have multiple checkmarks (for instance, every season from 11th through 12th grade), indicating ongoing commitments of time."
