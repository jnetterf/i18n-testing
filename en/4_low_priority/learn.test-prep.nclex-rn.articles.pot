msgid "*Diagnosing heart failure:* There is no one specific test for heart failure. Your healthcare provider will likely start by taking a medical history, reviewing your symptoms and risk factors, and doing a physical examination to check for signs of congestion, or abnormal heart sounds. You may need to provide a blood sample to test for kidney, liver, or thyroid disease, all of which may affect heart function. In addition, you may undergo various imaging tests that visualize the condition of your lungs and heart. These include X-rays, computerized tomography (CT), or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which may reveal whether or not your heart is enlarged, and locate fluid buildup in your lungs or heart, as well as help diagnose other heart problems, including causes of heart failure. Other useful tests include: an electrocardiogram, which tests the electrical activity of your heart and can reveal abnormal heart rhythms; an echocardiogram, which can distinguish systolic (abnormal pumping) and diastolic heart failure (abnormal filling), as well as indicate valve problems, and other heart abnormalities; measurement of your ejection fraction (during an echocardiogram, or by a variety of other procedures), which can determine how well your heart is pumping, classify your heart failure, and help guide therapy; stress tests using a treadmill or a stationary bike, which measure how well your heart responds to exercise; a coronary angiogram and ventriculogram, which can reveal narrowed arteries, and the strength of the pumping action of the left ventricle and the health of the heart valves, respectively; and myocardial biopsy, which can help diagnose heart muscle diseases that cause heart failure."

msgid "*Left-sided heart failure* reduces cardiac output to the body’s organs and tissues; however, the first symptoms are often caused by fluid buildup and impaired gas exchange in the lungs. Typical signs and symptoms include shortness of breath, rapid breathing, orthopnea (shortness of breath when lying flat, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea (attacks of severe shortness of breath and coughing that generally occur at night), and sometimes crackling noises that can be heard coming from the lungs. Reduced cardiac output may also cause general fatigue due to the reduced ability to oxygenate blood and deliver it around the body, and your healthcare provider may be able to hear abnormal heart sounds or murmurs that sometimes occur when the heart is enlarged, when blood pressure inside the heart is raised, or when the heart valves are malfunctioning. In more severe cases of heart failure, you may experience other symptoms related to a lack of oxygen in the organs and tissues, such as cold, clammy hands and feet, cyanosis (blue or purplish colored skin), weakness, dizziness, and fainting."

msgid "*Left-sided heart failure:* There are two types of left-sided heart failure, *systolic failure* and *diastolic failure*. Systolic heart failure occurs when the contraction of the muscle wall of the left ventricle malfunctions, which compromises its pumping action. This causes a decrease in the ejection fraction below the normal range, and over time, enlargement of the ventricle. Diastolic heart failure occurs when the left ventricle muscle wall is unable to relax normally, because the muscle has become stiff. When this happens, the heart does not fill properly, although the ejection fraction usually remains within the normal range, the stroke volume is reduced. Regardless of the malfunction, left-sided heart failure leaves the heart unable to pump enough blood into the circulation to meet the body’s demands, and increased pressure within the heart causes blood to backup in the pulmonary circulation, producing congestion in your lungs."

msgid "*Right-sided heart failure* occurs in about one in 20 cases of heart failure, often following left-sided heart failure. Many of the symptoms are related to fluid retention in various organs and tissues. In particular, congestion in peripheral capillary beds causes swelling under the skin (peripheral edema) that may move around according to the forces of gravity. For example, your feet and ankles may swell when you are standing up, while areas of your lower back may swell when you are lying down (known as sacral edema). Peripheral edema in your legs may then lead to nocturia, the need to urinate frequently during the night. This happens because fluid retained in your legs during the day flows back into your bloodstream when you lay down, and is processed into urine in your kidneys while you sleep. In more severe cases, the edema caused by right-sided heart failure, may result in pitting peripheral edema, a swollen abdomen due to fluid retention in the space within the abdominal cavity (ascites), or liver enlargement due to fluid retention around the liver.

"- An increased heart rate due to increased sympathetic nervous system activity, the part of the nervous system responsible for accelerating heart rate, constricting blood vessels and raising blood pressure. Although increased heart rate helps maintain cardiac output, it also means more oxygen is needed by the heart itself -  increased cardiac perfusion may worsen coronary artery disease or cause arrhythmias, as well as stimulate increases in muscle mass leading to heart enlargement.\n"
"- Increased blood pressure due to sympathetic nervous system activity (increases the amount of work the heart has to perform).\n"
"- Increased blood volume and blood pressure due to secretion of antidiuretic hormone in response to sympathetic nervous system activity, which causes fluid retention in the kidneys.\n"
"- Salt and fluid retention by the kidneys caused as a result of reduced blood flow to the kidneys, which ultimately leads to the secretion of aldosterone, a hormone that stimulates absorption of sodium (Na$^+$) by the kidneys, and regulates the balance of salt and water in the bloodstream.\n"
"- Heart muscle remodelling caused by chronically high levels of a number of hormones including catecholamines, renin, angiotensin, and aldosterone.\n"
"- Decreased muscle strength due skeletal muscle atrophy resulting from reduced perfusion.\n"

msgid "Although the body has mechanisms to counteract heart failure, there will be times when the decreased blood flow cannot keep up with body’s oxygen demands. Poor oxygenation of the body’s organs can cause ischemia in these tissues, which can be quite damaging, e.g., to the kidneys, heart, and brain.  Many patients with congestive heart failure will present at the hospital with kidney damage and increased nitrogen in their blood. The primary function of the kidney is to filter the blood, but in order to function properly, it must also be well supplied with oxygen and nutrients. When blood flow to the kidney is reduced, kidney function is compromised due to the decreased supply of oxygen and nutrients, as well as a loss of filtering capacity.

msgid "Blood circulates through the chambers of your heart in a specific sequence. The right ventricle pumps blood out of your heart to your lungs, where it picks up oxygen. It returns from the lungs and flows into the left atrium and then into the left ventricle, which pumps it back out into the circulatory system that supplies the rest of your body, it finally returns back to the heart, flowing into the right atrium. One-way valves between the heart’s chambers keep the blood cycling through the heart in the right direction. The valves have flaps, called cusps, which open when blood is pumped through them and snap shut to prevent back-flow. The heart sounds are produced when the atrioventricular valves, followed by the semilunar valves snap shut. The cycling of blood through your heart occurs in two phases: diastole the period of time when the ventricles are relaxed allowing blood to flow into them from the atria; and systole, the period of time when the ventricles contract and eject blood into the aorta and pulmonary vein. These phases make up one cardiac cycle, or heartbeat."

msgid "Heart failure is caused by any condition that damages or weakens your heart, reducing its ability to pump blood efficiently such as heart attacks, high blood pressure, coronary artery disease, or infection. Initially your heart tries to make up for the loss of cardiac output, by developing more muscle mass, enlarging, and pumping faster. Changes may also occur in your circulatory system, as your body adjusts to lower cardiac output. For example, your blood vessels may narrow to increase blood pressure, and blood may be diverted away from less essential tissues and organs, such as the kidneys, as the body tries to compensate for the heart’s reduced power. Overtime, the increased workload leads to changes in the heart muscle itself (known as remodelling), causing it to stiffen, and further reducing it’s ability to pump blood efficiently, which leads to worsening heart failure. As your heart increasingly struggles to keep up with the body’s demand for blood and oxygen, characteristic signs and symptoms of heart failure begin to appear."

msgid "*Diagnosing hypertension*: Blood pressure is usually measured using a pressure cuff or an electronic device placed on your upper arm. A blood pressure reading is written as two numbers, representing the maximum pressure in the circulatory system when the heart pumps blood out (systolic pressure), and the minimum pressure when the heart refills (diastolic pressure). Blood pressure is measured in millimeters of mercury (mm Hg). Normal resting blood pressure in an adult is approximately 120 / 80 mm Hg. However, your blood pressure can fluctuate from minute to minute, and readings are generally higher in the afternoon and lower at night. "

This, together with reducing high fat, and calorie laden foods can help you reach and maintain a healthy weight. Another way to lower your blood pressure is to increase the amount of exercise you do. Routinely exercising not only helps to lower your blood pressure, but may give you more energy, and is a great way to reduce stress.

High blood pressure is dangerous because the higher your blood pressure gets, the harder your heart has to work to pump blood around your body, and the more likely your heart and blood vessels will be damaged. Without treatment, hypertension can cause a heart attack, enlargement of your heart, and/or heart failure. Your blood vessels may start to bulge, burst, or clog, and excessive pressure inside the vessels in your brain may cause a brain bleed leading to a stroke.

msgid "Your *heart* is divided into four chambers. The two upper chambers are the atria (singular atrium) and the two lower chambers are the ventricles. As your heart pumps, one way valves between the chambers keep the blood flowing in a specific direction. Blood passes through your heart twice as it makes a complete tour of your body. Starting from your heart, it is pumped from the right ventricle to your lungs, where it picks up oxygen. It then returns to the left atrium, flows into the left ventricle, and is pumped out of there to the rest of your body. With this done, the blood returns to the right atrium, flows into the right ventricle, and the cycle starts again."

msgid "Your body uses multiple complicated, overlapping processes to control blood pressure. Together, these systems do this by regulating vasodilatation and vasoconstriction, the widening and narrowing of blood vessels, as well as rates of excretion of salt and water, which is how your body adjusts blood volume. Around 5-10% of people have a specific underlying medical condition that causes a malfunction in one or more of the physiological processes that maintain blood pressure; for example, chronic kidney disease or thyroid disease. However, the majority of people with high blood pressure have what is known as *essential hypertension*, meaning the cause is unknown. "

msgid "- Hemorrhagic strokes are less common, but are more deadly. Uncontrolled bleeding can flood an area of the brain, causing localized pressure and swelling that damages or kills the brain cells. Hemorrhagic strokes can also cause a shortage of oxygen and nutrient delivery beyond the leak. Bleeding may occur at the surface of your brain, just under your skull, or from a burst artery deep within your brain. High blood pressure and/or defects in your arteries are usually to blame for a brain bleed. The common defects include aneurysms, which are weak areas in the blood vessel wall that fill with blood, bulge out like a little balloon, and can burst, particularly if you have high blood pressure, and malformations of blood vessels that are usually present at birth.

msgid "- Ischemic strokes are more common. There are two types, *thrombotic* and *embolic* strokes. A thrombotic stroke occurs when the blood clot has formed in one of the major arteries leading to the brain, while an embolic stroke is when a blood clot forms somewhere else in the body, travels around your body in your bloodstream and then lodges in your brain. Loose blood clots are usually linked to atherosclerosis, a buildup of plaque (a combination of fatty materials, calcium and scar tissue), on the inside walls of your arteries, which narrows them, and interferes with or blocks the flow of blood. Blood clots form when a plaque ruptures. "

A mini-stroke should really be considered a warning that something is going wrong. You can think of a mini-stroke as getting lucky because the blood clot quickly dissolved on its own. However, there’s no way to predict that is what will happen when another clot forms. While for many people there is no warning mini-stroke before a full stroke, if you do get one, there is a good chance that you will have a full stroke within the next 3 months. So, take it seriously!

That said, every stroke is different and sometimes your brain can compensate to some extent, by shifting the brain function of the damaged part of your brain to the corresponding area on the undamaged side of your brain. This means the damage caused by either type of stroke may be permanent but could only be temporary. Signs and symptoms caused by a mini-stroke will usually last less than an hour, and generally do not do permanent damage."

msgid "There are things that you can’t control such as your gender, family history and age, that affect the likelihood of whether or not you will have a stroke. The risk is higher if you are male. Strokes also seem to run in families, so your risk goes up if one of your immediate relatives has had a stroke. Your risk for strokes also increases as you get older. Then there are other risk factors that increase your chances of having a stroke. These are called “modifiable” risk factors, which means they can potentially be treated or controlled. These risk factors tend to be interconnected and linked to lifestyle. The most important one for any kind of stroke is high blood pressure, which can damage and weaken your arteries so that they clog or burst more easily. High blood pressure is responsible for over 50% of strokes.$^2$ Other important risk factors include atrial fibrillation, which means you an irregular heartbeat, high cholesterol, diabetes, physical inactivity and smoking. The more risk factors you have, the more likely you are to have a stroke."

msgid "- Diabetes can alter your body’s response to certain diseases. For example, diabetics who have heart attacks are more likely to present with atypical symptoms (and oftentimes present without chest pain altogether). This is likely partly due to nerve damage. Many diabetics have peripheral neuropathy, a nerve condition where they feel constant numbness and tingling in their toes and feet and have trouble recognizing pain in those limbs. These patients likely have nerve damage to other parts of their body, including their heart. The atypical symptoms lead to a delay in diagnosis of heart attacks."

msgid "- Sometimes, pregnant women can develop diabetes while they are pregnant, a process called gestational diabetes. This usually reverses once they give birth, but can persist after the pregnancy. Gestational diabetes is similar to type 2 diabetes: the hallmark of this disease is insulin resistance. During the second trimester, pregnant women increase their resistance to insulin and have higher blood sugar levels, likely to increase delivery of glucose to the fetus. Most women increase the amount of insulin produced from the pancreas, but women with gestational diabetes cannot produce enough and functionally become type 2 diabetics throughout their pregnancy."

High glucose levels lead to chronic inflammation in the body, including the walls of the arteries in the blood. This chronic inflammation leads to atherosclerosis, a buildup of a plaque with a fibrous cap on the walls of the arteries. This narrows the arteries and leads to decreased blood flow in the arteries. In addition, these plaques can rupture and lead to formation of a blood clot which blocks off blood flow. If this happens in the brain or the heart, it causes a stroke or a heart attack. "

msgid "People with type 2 diabetes can still make insulin, but their cells have some degree of insulin resistance. Type 2 diabetes is a continuum which begins with insulin resistance and can end in loss of insulin secretion. When cells initially become resistant to insulin, the body increases the amount of insulin made to counteract this effect and keep glucose levels in a normal range. In fact, early type 2 diabetics have higher levels of insulin in their body than non-diabetics. Eventually the body cannot compensate enough, and blood glucose levels begin to rise. The pancreatic cells begin working overtime to produce more and more insulin and eventually burn out. As type 2 diabetes continues to progress, patients have to start taking insulin to ensure they have enough of the molecule in their body."

"Type 1:\n"
"The classic initial presentation of type 1 diabetes is increased thirst, increased urination, weight loss, hunger due to starvation of cells, and fatigue. As blood glucose levels increase, the body tries to remove excess glucose in the urine and dilute the blood by increasing water intake. However, many patients are initially diagnosed when they come to the hospital very sick in a state called diabetic ketoacidosis. This occurs when cells use alternative energy producing mechanisms, leading to high levels of byproducts called ketoacids. Ketoacids acidify the blood, leading to dangerous acid base disturbances. Diabetic ketoacidosis causes abdominal pain, nausea/vomiting, and drowsiness and is a potentially life threatening condition."

msgid "Type 2 diabetics have more options. Initial therapy for type 2 diabetics with mild disease is lifestyle modification: a healthy diet with exercise to help lose weight. If this fails, the first medication used is typically Metformin, a drug which stops the liver from making glucose in a process called gluconeogenesis. It also increases the number of insulin receptors present on cells, so they become more sensitive to insulin.  Between Metformin and insulin therapy are a number of drugs which help increase the release of insulin from the pancreas. These include sulfonylureas, a-glucosidase inhibitors, and glinides."

msgid "When you eat food, the amount of glucose in your blood skyrockets. That’s because the food you eat is converted into glucose (usable energy for your cells) and enters your blood to be transported to your cells around the body.  Special cells in your pancreas sense the increase of glucose  and release insulin into your blood. Insulin has a lot of different jobs, but one of its main tasks is to help decrease blood glucose levels. It does this by activating a system which transports glucose from your blood into your cells. It also decreases blood glucose by stimulating an enzyme called glycogen synthase in the liver. This molecule is responsible for making glycogen, a long string of glucose, which is then stored in the liver and used in the future when there is a period of low blood glucose. As insulin works on your body, the amount of glucose in the blood slowly returns to the same level it was before you ate.. This glucose level when you haven’t eaten recently (called fasting glucose) sits around 3.5-6 mmol/L (70-110 mg/dL). Just after a meal, your blood glucose can jump as high as 7.8mmol/L (140 mg/dL) depending on how much and what you ate. "

msgid "Behaviors that increase the likelihood of transmission, also increase the risk of gastroenteritis. These include failing to breastfeed your baby (up to 12 months of age provides the best protection), using a baby bottle to feed your baby (these easily become contaminated as they are difficult to clean), storing cooked food at room temperature for several hours before eating it (this allows the bacteria to multiply), storing drinking water that could become contaminated before you drink it, or drinking water that is contaminated at source, not washing your hands properly after using the washroom, or before preparing or handling food, and not disposing of feces hygienically, particularly baby diapers. In addition you increase your risk of gastroenteritis, also known as “food poisoning”, by eating certain higher risk foods including raw or undercooked meat or poultry, unpasteurized milk or cheese, eggs, fruit, and vegetable juices.

The signs and symptoms are generally similar regardless of the microbe causing the infection, and usually start within one to three days after you become infected. Diarrhea -  which is when your stool becomes watery, and you need to go to the toilet frequently and urgently - is the most common symptom, and can range from mild to severe. It is not uncommon to experience one or more other symptoms, such as stomach cramps, vomiting, nausea, fever, chills, or headache. Viral infections usually get better within a week to ten days, but some bacterial infections can cause severe abdominal pain that may last several weeks. "

For example, some medications, such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatories that are commonly used to treat pain caused by inflammatory diseases like arthritis, as well as certain foods; for example, gluten. Long-term, or over use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories may damage the digestive tract by interfering with mucus secretion, causing ulcers and bleeding. In contrast, for some people, gluten triggers an autoimmune reaction that destroys enterocytes, the cells in the inner lining of the intestine that are responsible for absorbing nutrients, disrupts the structure of the intestinal wall, and inflames the intestines. With continued exposure to the irritant, you are likely to experience *chronic* gastroenteritis with diarrhea and other symptoms lasting more than four weeks."

Children are particularly vulnerable to gastroenteritis because of a lack of immunity. Risk is increased in the developing world where transmission is increased due to poor hygiene, crowded living conditions, and poor nutrition. Although adults are less susceptible as a result of acquired immunity, the risk of gastroenteritis increases again as your immune system weakens with age. This means elderly people are more susceptible especially if living close together in nursing homes where infections spread easily."

If your symptoms are very severe, you may need to take antidiarrheal or antiemetic medications to reduce diarrhea and vomiting. There are no specific medications for treating viral gastroenteritis; however, you may be given antibiotics if a specific causative microbe has been identified.  Antibiotics are only effective against bacterial infections and are often avoided as much as possible in order to prevent the development of antibiotic resistant strains of bacteria.

Within a week or two, the infection takes hold and signs and symptoms of fever, headache, fatigue, and swollen lymph glands make many people feel like they are getting the flu. At this time, your immune system is operating at full throttle, aggressively fighting the infection, and typically, after a few weeks, the flu-like symptoms will pass and you will start producing HIV antibodies."

During this stage, your immune system and HIV have come into balance and the infection is partially controlled. However, HIV continues to slowly multiply and as time passes it steadily kills off your CD4 cells making you increasingly immunodeficient. A key point here is that during this time most people with HIV don’t look or feel sick, and may not even know that they are infected."

In order to understand how HIV and AIDS are connected we need to take a closer look at how the immune system works. Your immune system is a complex network of organs, tissues and cells, called white blood cells. The white blood cells are made in the bone marrow, migrate to other parts of the immune system such as the lymph nodes, spleen, and thymus and float around in the bloodstream. The components of your immune system work together to prevent germs from entering, growing and multiplying inside your body. "

"Around 500 | Fungal infections (*Candida*): The first opportunistic infections that you are likely to get if you have HIV are minor fungal infections caused by an overgrowth of *Candida*, the fungus that causes diaper rash in babies. *Candida* infections commonly occur in the mouth and throat (oral candidiasis or thrush), airways and lungs, or vagina (vaginal candidiasis). This fungus typically forms white patches on your gums, tongue and lining of your mouth, and can make it so painful to swallow that you lose your appetite. An infection in your vagina will cause itching or burning, and soreness and redness accompanied by a thick white discharge. | \n"
"500 to 200 | *Kaposi’s sarcoma*: Kaposi’s sarcoma is a tumour caused by a human herpes virus. The tumour usually appears as purplish lesions on the skin of your legs or face, or inside your mouth, and can spread to other parts of your body without you knowing it. If the cancer spreads to your guts or lungs, it can cause bleeding or difficulty with breathing that can be life threatening. | \n"
"200 to 100 | *Pneumocystis jiroveci* pneumonia: Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia is a type of pneumonia that severely affects the lungs and is the most common opportunistic infection in people with AIDS. Signs and symptoms of pneumocystis can include shortness of breath, fever, dry cough and chest pain. It usually takes weeks or months to develop, but can be life threatening if not treated. | \n"
"100 to 50 | *Cytomegalovirus*: Cytomegalovirus is everywhere and it is thought that most people throughout the world have been exposed to it, but mostly didn’t notice. Nevertheless; like HIV, once you have the virus you have it for life. If you are HIV infected and have low CD4 cell counts, you should not be surprised if you get a cytomegalovirus infection in your gut, or your eyes (cytomegalovirus retinitis), where it may lead to blindness if you don’t get treatment. | \n"
"less than 50 | *Mycobacterium avium* complex: Mycobacterium avium complex exists everywhere in the environment and can infect the lungs and intestines of people with severe immunodeficiency. It can be deadly if it spreads to other parts of your body.  | "

The group of white blood cells responsible for eliminating viruses and tumor cells are called *lymphocytes*. There are several different types of lymphocytes, all with different jobs. The ones that are especially relevant to HIV infection are the CD4 lymphocytes or CD4 cells. These cells are a bit like policemen, as they patrol the bloodstream and identify any viruses or tumor cells that shouldn’t be there. If they find something they don’t like the look of, they send out signals that activate other lymphocytes including a group of killer lymphocytes which, as their name suggests, seek out and eliminate the invaders."

Although the medicine does not get rid of HIV entirely, it gives your CD4 cells a chance to recover so that they can fight off opportunistic infections and cancers. If you don’t take ART, you are likely to die within 12 years from the time you first got infected. On the other hand, if you do take ART, you can have a life expectancy equal to or even higher than the general population."

msgid "You only know for sure that you have HIV if you get tested. The most common HIV test is a blood test. Your doctor will take a small sample and send it off to a laboratory for analysis, and you usually get the result within a few days. Some clinics offer point-of-care tests. All you need to do for this is give a small sample of saliva, or a spot of blood from a pin prick, and you get the result there and then. Both of these types of test detect whether or not you have HIV antibodies. The downside is that it generally takes a few weeks for your immune system to start producing HIV antibodies after you first got infected, and occasionally up to 6 months. This means, you can test HIV negative, but may in fact be HIV positive. There are other diagnostic tests that can detect the presence of HIV earlier, including the HIV p24 antigen test and the nucleic acid amplification test, but they are not used extensively at this time$^1$"

However, if you get *P. falciparum* malaria, you are likely to feel unwell even between attacks and, without treatment, you may die. Why do you think this might be? One explanation is that the *P. falciparum* malaria infects red blood cells, regardless of whether they are young or old, producing very high numbers of parasites in the blood. *P. vivax*, on the other hand, only infects young red blood cells, which limits the number of parasites that can accumulate."

msgid "- People who were born and raised, or who lived as a child in a region where malaria occurs, but who as adults are living in a malaria-free country, are often at extremely high risk of getting malaria when they return for a visit. Why would that be? First, any immunity to malaria that they may have gained through childhood exposure decreases with time. Although they may not realize it, this means that like other non-immune travellers they are very vulnerable to the disease if they get bitten by an infected mosquito. Second, people visiting friends and family are more likely to travel to remote regions where malaria transmission rates may be particularly high. Lack of awareness of the need to take precautions against mosquito bites puts travelers visiting friends and family at particularly high risk of disease."

msgid "3. When they are ready, the young adult parasites leave your liver cells for your bloodstream where they infect red blood cells. This begins a cycle of asexual reproduction in which broods of thousands of newly formed merozoites are produced and released over 1-3 days (again, the time depends on which species of malaria you have). It is the cyclical release of broods of merozoites into your bloodstream during this stage that causes the periodic feverish symptoms of malaria. Importantly, not all merozoites are destined for an asexual existence, some develop sexually instead. This produces male and female forms (gametocytes) that your blood cells carry around in your bloodstream."

All four species of malaria can cause early, or prodromal “flu-like” symptoms such as headache, slight fever, muscle pain, and nausea, which coincide with increasing numbers of parasites in your bloodstream. A few days later these symptoms are often followed by periodic febrile attacks, also known as malarial paroxysms. Paroxysms typically last 4-8 hours and have 3 stages; a 15-to-60 minute cold stage when you shiver and feel very cold, a 2-6 hour hot stage when your fever may reach as high as 41$^o$C, and finally, a 2-4 hour sweating stage during which your fever drops rapidly. The febrile attacks are likely to leave you feeling exhausted, although after some sleep, you may feel quite well, until the next paroxysm. "

In fact, when it comes to killing people, the most deadly animal in the world is a tiny insect: the mosquito! Unlike other dangerous creatures, mosquitoes do their deadly work by spreading diseases - one of the worst of these is malaria."

It can happen suddenly or gradually, and is related to the damage the poliovirus did to your neurons when you first became infected. Common signs and symptoms include progressive muscle weakness and difficulty with coordination, general fatigue, muscle atrophy, sleep and breathing disorders, depression, and cognitive problems such as memory loss. It is thought that the symptoms may be related to the remaining healthy neurons being unable to maintain the production of new nerve roots, so that eventually denervation is greater than reinnervation.$^5$"

msgid "If the poliovirus reaches your CNS, the symptoms become much more sinister, and you develop what is known as *paralytic polio*. Muscle weakness and paralysis usually progress rapidly, often accompanied by fever, muscle pain, loss of reflexes and floppy limbs. It is common for paralysis to affect only one side of your body, and the paralysis of legs and arms is often more severe closer to the spinal cord than in the fingertips and toes. Within a week or two of infection, the virus can do sufficient damage to your motor neurons, spinal cord, and brainstem to leave you permanently paralyzed. However, in most cases, muscle function will return to some degree, and many people who go on to develop paralytic polio will recover completely. That said, muscle weakness and paralysis lasting a year or more may be permanent.$^1$"

Although in the vast majority of cases a poliovirus infection is harmless, if it makes its way into your *brain* or *spinal cord* it can cause paralysis, and even death. In the mid 20th-century, poliovirus infections reached epidemic proportions. Today the threat of polio has been largely eliminated in the developed world due to the introduction of vaccines. However, its continued existence is risky for people living in the most afflicted countries, with children under 5 years of age being particularly vulnerable to infection. That said, public health officials believe that complete eradication of polio may be possible, and in 1999, one of the three strains of the poliovirus was eliminated entirely."

Eventually poliovirus may break out into your bloodstream and if this happens, it is transported widely around your body. In most cases, your body eradicates poliovirus while it is still in your intestines, or your blood stream. However, in some people, the poliovirus is able to get into the CNS. Once there, it infects and replicates inside motor neurons, copying itself thousands of times over. When it is ready to emerge, it destroys the neurons and spreads to neighbouring uninfected cells. At this point, the disease is medically classified according to the neuronal damage that occurs, and the region of the CNS affected:"

However, you can also get it through direct contact with someone infected with the virus, who can be contagious without exhibiting any symptoms, and who can spread the virus via their feces, for weeks. In fact, polio is so contagious that anyone living with a recently infected person is likely to become infected too. Because poliovirus can survive for weeks outside the human body, it can also be transmitted through contaminated water and food. For these reasons, is most easily spread in communities with poor infrastructure, poor sanitation and crowded living conditions, and young children are at particularly high risk of infection. The risk of infection is also higher when your immune system is not fully functional, such as when you are very young, old or pregnant. Not surprisingly, other conditions that weaken your immune system such as HIV or having your tonsils removed, may also put you at increased risk of a polio infection."

The sensory neurons are the ones that respond to stimuli, such as heat or light, or chemicals, both inside and outside of your body. These neurons transmit this information to the CNS, where interneurons decipher it and then pass instructions along motor neurons to the parts of your body where an action is required such as muscles or glands. Your CNS can instruct your body to make two main types of actions: *voluntary* actions that your brain controls consciously and *involuntary* actions that your brain does not consciously control. A reflex action is an involuntary action that provides a good example of how the nervous system works. When information is received by a sensory neuron, for example when you are poked with a pin, it travels to the CNS where it is processed. Your CNS then sends instructions via your motor neurons that tell your hand muscles to move away from the source of pain."

For about one in ten people though, it becomes chronic and progressively damages the liver, causing severe nausea, vomiting and jaundice, and sometimes liver cancer.$^2$ If you get HIV, on the other hand, you have it for life. HIV attacks your white blood cells, which reduces your body’s ability to fight off other infections. If you don’t get treatment, usually after an average of 10 to 12 years with few or no symptoms, you will develop AIDS. This is a life-threatening illness with many different symptoms caused by multiple infections by organisms that are normally harmless, but that may be very dangerous when up against a damaged immune system."

msgid "Although your skin and mucous membranes are well equipped to keep infections at bay, germs can overpower these defences and cause an infection. Because the mucous membranes are thinner than skin, they are more vulnerable to microbes, which can sometimes get through. Once inside, the microbes multiply inside your body and get into your body fluids including your blood, semen, and vaginal fluids. During sex, these fluids often mix together and get spread in and around your genitals, anus, or mouth. This means the microbes are perfectly positioned to cross the mucous membranes of the vagina, penis, urethra, rectum, mouth, or throat from one partner to the other and vice versa. It’s also possible for some types of microbes that cause STIs to enter your body through tiny cuts or lesions on your skin, or even through your eyes."

msgid "Every day around 1 million people get an STI. You have about equal chance of getting one whether you are male or female. Around half of these new infections are chlamydia, gonorrhoea, syphilis, and trichomoniasis - all of which can be cured.1 More than 500 million people have herpes, and almost 3 million women have HPV. The chances of getting an STI vary in different parts of the world, but no matter where you live, you are more likely to get one if you are sexually active and under 25 years old.3 Because it is so often impossible to know if someone has an STI, and exposure to just a small amount of microbes can cause an infection, it is wise to assume there is a chance you could get infected whenever you have unprotected sex."

When you are healthy and everything is functioning properly, your body is able to keep the bacteria contained and under control. Sometimes, your immune system may become weaker and is no longer able to control the growth of the tuberculosis bacteria; for example, if you have a disease that attacks your immune system, like HIV/AIDS. When this happens, the calcified shell of the granuloma can deteriorate and your tuberculosis infection may transition from latent to active. This can occur anytime from weeks, to years after you were first infected. Once the tuberculosis granulomas open, the bacteria are able to emerge, inhabit your lungs, and damage the surrounding tissue. The damage causes the spongy, balloon-like tissue of the alveoli to harden and become fibrous, making them useless for gas exchange."

MDR-tuberculosis is curable using combinations of other 2nd-line anti-tuberculosis drugs; although these are expensive and not always available, especially in countries with limited resources. More recently, even more extreme drug resistant strains have appeared, called extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-tuberculosis).

msgid "Eventually, the lung tissue cells themselves begin to deteriorate and die. When the bacteria reach a part of your lungs which connects to an airway, they are expelled when you cough or sneeze. This releases them in an aerosol of fine droplets that may be inhaled by another person (droplet transmission). Like the flu, tuberculosis is an airborne disease, meaning that the infectious droplets can travel long distances and remain suspended in the air for a long time. Consequently, it is possible for the bacteria to circulate throughout entire buildings, and you can catch tuberculosis by entering a room that an infected person left hours ago. Masks that filter the air (e.g., N95 masks) are often used by healthcare professionals who are caring for patients with tuberculosis, and these patients are often isolated in negative pressure rooms that prevent the contaminated air from escaping from the room."

msgid "For about one in five people, the infection is so severe that cavities begin to form within the lung tissue. If these areas start to bleed, tuberculosis bacteria are able to enter the bloodstream. If this happens, they can travel to other parts of your body, causing additional symptoms. A tuberculosis infection outside of the lungs is called an extrapulmonary tuberculosis infection and most commonly occurs in your lymphatic system, your genitourinary system, and/or in your bones and joints. However, in some cases extrapulmonary tuberculosis is disseminated, which means the infection has spread widely throughout your whole body. "

msgid "The most common way to diagnose whether or not you have tuberculosis is a tuberculosis skin test, also known as a tuberculin test. Your healthcare provider will inject a small amount of a substance called tuberculin purified protein derivative, or PPD (prepared from dead tuberculosis bacteria), usually just under the skin of your inside forearm. If you develop a hard red bump during the following 48 to 72 hours, and depending on its size, you have tested positive for tuberculosis. Unfortunately, this test is not 100% reliable and sometimes gives false positives, or false negatives, as well as generally giving a positive result if you have been vaccinated against tuberculosis. Because of this, if you test negative, but are in, or have been in, a situation that puts you at high risk for tuberculosis, your healthcare provider may order a blood test to confirm whether or not your skin test was a false negative.

Unfortunately, it is not very effective in adults. One reason for this may be that adults are likely to have been exposed to other strains of mycobacterium in the environment that give partial immunity against *M. tuberculosis*, and that this prevents the development of the full immune response to the vaccine that is necessary to protect against future infection. It is also worth noting that a vaccine is not a treatment for a disease, it prevents a disease from occurring, so must be given before you have become infected. "

However, unlike many other bacterial infections, which only require a short course of medicine, tuberculosis drugs generally need to be taken for at least *six to nine months*. This is because the bacteria can remain latent, or dormant in your lungs for long periods of time without making you sick. It is very important to get treated properly to eliminate both latent and active tuberculosis bacteria. Your healthcare provider will choose the antibiotics you need based on whether or not your infection is latent or active, where the infection is in your body (lungs or elsewhere), your general state of health, and whether or not you have a drug resistant strain."

These include times of life when your immune system is weaker; for example when you are very young or very old, or when you have certain diseases that reduce immune function, such as HIV/AIDS, diabetes or cancer, or are receiving immunosuppressive medications for these or other diseases. The risk of catching tuberculosis is also linked to crowded, poorly ventilated living conditions. This is a common situation for people living in poverty, for whom malnutrition, lack access to medical care, and substance abuse may all contribute to an increased risk of becoming infected. It is worth noting that poverty is not the only driver of crowding and inadequate living conditions. In many countries, prisons also make transmission of tuberculosis very efficient, for these reasons. Finally, drug resistant tuberculosis has been reported in 100 countries worldwide, including sub-Saharan Africa, India, China and Pakistan.$^1$ Around 10% of people are infected with this form, which is very hard to treat.$^1$ Your chances of catching tuberculosis is higher if you live in or travel to these regions, where it is becoming a major public health problem.

For some people, the fear of experiencing panic in a public place is so extreme that they are unable to leave their neighborhood, their house, or even their bedroom."

This type of exposure can take many forms, and is tailored to the specific needs of each person. Sometimes this is done gradually in a therapist’s office over the course of many weeks or months, while for others it may be appropriate to do so in a single session."

But like any alarm, fear works best when it goes off at the right time and at the right intensity. Your alarm clock is great for getting you up in the morning, but if it were so quiet that you couldn’t hear it (or so loud that it was deafening) it might actually do more harm than good. You also probably wouldn’t be very happy if your alarm went off when you didn’t need to wake up (so much for sleeping in!)."

msgid "*Dementia* may occur anytime neurons get damaged. The damage may be anywhere within the brain, and in more than one area at the same time. Most dementias are caused by neurodegenerative diseases, most commonly Alzheimer’s disease, Lewy body dementia and  frontotemporal dementia. These diseases cause clumps of abnormal proteins to build up inside neurons, damaging them, and causing them to slowly degenerate and die. Not surprisingly, this disrupts the production of neurotransmitters and interrupts brain signals. In addition to these, vascular dementia is another common cause of progressive dementia. In this case, brain damage occurs when the blood supply to the neurons is reduced or blocked, again causing them to malfunction or die. Blood vessel damage and blockage may result during a stroke, or may be caused by high blood pressure or other blood vessel disorders. There are also several other rare neurodegenerative diseases, and many other less common causes of dementia, such as infections, or dietary deficiencies."

"- *Alzheimer’s* symptoms usually start in your mid to late 60s, although a small proportion of people get early onset Alzheimer's, with symptoms starting in their 40s or 50s. This form of Alzheimer’s has a strong genetic link and typically runs in families.\n"
"- *Vascular dementia* is rare if you are under 65, but usually starts more suddenly than Alzheimer’s. Diagnosis may be complicated by the fact that you have Alzheimer’s or another dementia at the same time. People at risk for vascular dementia often have a history of smoking, cardiac dysrhythmia, hypertension, diabetes, and coronary artery disease.\n"
"- *Lewy body dementia*: Lewy bodies are abnormal clumps of protein that build up in neurons causing brain signalling malfunctions; they are often found in the brains of people with Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease (primarily a movement disorder). Lewy body dementia is similar to Alzheimer’s, but can be distinguished by unique symptoms such as rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder, and fluctuations between confusion and clarity.\n"
"- *Frontotemporal dementia* often has an earlier onset than Alzheimer’s, generally in your 50s or early 60s. The brain damage occurs at the front of your brain in regions that control personality, behaviour, and language."

msgid "Memantine is the first drug in a new class of drugs (called N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor, or NMDA receptor antagonists) that has been approved to treat moderate to severe Alzheimer’s disease. While cholinesterase inhibitors used to treat Alzheimer’s help raise the levels of the neurotransmitter known as acetylcholine, memantine works by regulating a chemical called glutamate. Glutamate is the salt of glutamic acid. It is an essential amino acid that is involved in many chemical processes that occur in living organisms, that lead to growth, production of energy, and elimination of waste. In the brain however, glutamate is an important neurotransmitter that’s involved in regulating almost everything your brain does including memory, cognition, and learning. For your brain to work well, glutamate has to be in the right place, at the right time, and in the right amount — too much or too little glutamate is harmful. In Alzheimer’s disease, excess glutamate accumulates when neurons get damaged, which can be devastating for functioning neurons. Memantine works by blocking the effects of too much glutamate, preventing cell death, and delaying some of the symptoms of moderate to severe Alzheimer’s disease. Because memantine has a different mechanism of action, it may be used in combination with cholinesterase inhibitors, which may improve outcomes for longer periods of time."

msgid "Your brain is your body’s control centre. It is full of millions of interconnected brain cells, called neurons that receive, process, and send messages that control and coordinate almost everything that you do. Your brain is divided into three main parts, the brain stem, cerebellum and cerebrum. These different regions are responsible for different functions, such as movement, speech, sense perception, emotions, heart rate, cognition and memory. Information travels back and forth from the brain to the body along neurons, in the form of electrical impulses. When a nerve impulse reaches the end of a neuron a chemical neurotransmitter is released, which stimulates the electrical nerve impulse in the next neuron, allowing it to “jump” from one neuron to the next. Neurons in different parts of the brain use different neurotransmitters to transfer information. Some neurotransmitters stimulate brain activity, others calm the brain, and some do both. When your brain is functioning well, these neurotransmitters are all in balance. "

msgid "“Has anyone seen my wallet?” “What time do I have to go to the dentist?” “What’s the name of that movie we went to last week?” We all ask these sorts of questions from time-to-time no matter our age; and not having a perfect memory is perfectly normal. It's also normal that our longer term memory, as well as our ability to remember things that only occur occasionally, fade a little as we age. Nevertheless, as we get into our sixties, many of us worry that forgetfulness or difficulty paying attention are signs of worse things to come. One of the most widespread fears as we age is dementia due to Alzheimer’s disease. "

msgid "Although the exact cause of substance use disorders is unknown, many prevention strategies have been identified. As was mentioned above, initiating drug use at a young age is a huge risk factor for developing a substance use disorder. Research has shown that prevention programs involving families, schools, communities, and health care providers, aimed at educating young people about the risks of drug use, are effective in reducing the prevalence of substance use disorders.

As you grow and develop, it also begins to respond to the satisfaction of needs that are important for more abstract goals (like getting a good grade on a test). Any substance that (either directly or indirectly) increases the release of dopamine has the potential to hijack your reward system, making you very motivated to use the substance again. For some people, the motivation for substance use can begin to outweigh the drive to satisfy other needs (getting enough sleep, eating enough, saving money) leading to harmful effects.

msgid "- A class of medications called *stimulants* is often used as a first step in treating ADHD. Stimulants work by increasing the amount of the chemical dopamine that is circulating in the brain. For people without ADHD, this surge of dopamine is very energizing (that’s why drugs that release dopamine are called stimulants!). Ironically, for people with ADHD, the increased dopamine seems to be calming and can help improve focus and behavioral control. Common side effects of these medications include reduced appetite and trouble sleeping. Medications work well to reduce ADHD symptoms *right now*, but unfortunately do nothing to reduce future symptoms (as soon as the pills wear off, your symptoms return)."

msgid "- Behavioral therapies focus on developing skills and strategies to counteract the symptoms of ADHD. These skills can range from practical things like organization and studying tools, to social skills training (understanding other people’s emotions, waiting your turn, etc.). Through working with a therapist, a person with ADHD learns to focus on the consequences (both good and bad) of their actions, which can help reduce hyperactivity and impulsivity. Behavioral therapy works well to reduce the problems caused by ADHD *in the future*, but doesn’t work as well as medication in reducing symptoms right away."

msgid "- Living or working with someone with untreated ADHD can be very difficult. Particularly for parents and teachers, dealing with the symptoms of ADHD can lead to frustration, guilt, anger, and exhaustion. These feelings can actually lead to even worse outcome for the person with ADHD. For example, a child with ADHD who is having trouble sitting still in school (at risk for poor academic performance) is constantly sent to detention because his teacher is frustrated by his distracting behavior (putting him at even greater risk for poor academic performance). Working to educate families and teachers about how to manage the needs of a child/student with ADHD is a very important part of treatment."

ABA  therapists help children learn to communicate, be social, take care of themselves, play appropriately, and perform in school.

"- *Genetics*: there is a strong genetic basis for autism. If you have a sibling with the disorder, you are 2.8x more likely to develop it yourself.\n"
"- *Parental age*: the risk of autism increases as parents get older. Women over the age of 35 are 1.2 times more likely to have a child with autism spectrum disorder and men over the age of 50 are 2.2 times more likely to have a child with the disorder. This may be because the genes found in sperm and egg cells can mutate as adults age.\n"
"- *Maternal health*: autism can develop after expectant mothers are exposed to certain illnesses or drugs during pregnancy. For example, infections during pregnancy (like rubella), exposure to psychiatric medication like antidepressants and anti-seizure drugs, and complications during pregnancy and delivery all increase the likelihood that a child will develop autism spectrum disorder.\n"
"- *Environmental factors*: infants are especially vulnerable to environmental factors because they are still developing. If babies are exposed to toxins during childhood, like pesticides, traffic-related air pollution, cyanide, methylene chloride, methanol, arsenic, or bisphenol-A (BPA) they are more likely to develop autism spectrum disorder.

msgid "Because autism spectrum disorder has such a strong genetic basis, it can’t be prevented. However, there are certain changes that can be made to decrease the risk of developing the disorder. For example, prospective mothers should try to minimize potential risks during pregnancy by avoiding alcohol, tobacco or other drugs, choosing nutrient dense foods, washing fruits and vegetables to remove pesticides, taking multivitamins, using stainless steel water bottles instead of plastic bottles, and avoiding prescription medications. They should also get immunized for rubella before trying to get pregnant."

msgid "Before we are born, we receive genetic information from our parents that help to make us who we are. Our genes act like a blueprint for our development and help form the basic architecture of our brain and body. Our physical development usually corresponds with our psychological and behavioral development, which means that as our brain grows, the foundation of our personality, feelings, thoughts, and behavior start to develop and emerge too. For example, as parts of the brain associated with language develop, babies start to babble and form sounds. This process usually happens in a predictable way and parents can expect certain behaviors, traits, and skills at certain times in their child’s life."

msgid "In 1998, a paper was published that linked the development of autism to childhood vaccines. The research had a huge influence on the public’s perception of vaccines and led to a powerful anti-vaccination movement that was backed by celebrities and activists across the country. Over 10 years later, the article was debunked, retracted, and the original author was stripped of his medical license – an investigation found that he had falsified and manipulated the data used to make his claims. Follow-up studies around the world have confirmed that there is no link between autism and vaccines, but many parents still avoid vaccinating their children, which puts them and others at risk for serious and sometimes deadly illnesses like measles and mumps.

Approximately 96% of cases of Down syndrome are caused by nondisjunction in either the sex cells of the parents, or the fertilized egg (trisomy 21 or mosaicism). In either case, the failure of chromosome 21 to separate is not caused by the parents having Down syndrome (meaning it is not inherited).

msgid "The human body is an amazing thing. We really do come in all shapes and sizes. This is true for the things we can see (like height or hair color) and for the thing we can’t see (like average heart rate). It seems like every time scientists try to find something that is truly the same for ALL people, they end up finding endless variations. Interestingly, these human differences can be found even at the level of our DNA! Some of these genetic variations are so small that they are unnoticeable, but some are substantial enough to change the way the body grows and develops."

"The mosaic form of Down syndrome is much less common, accounting for about 1% of cases.$^1$ In this form, the uneven separation of chromosome 21 happens shortly after an egg has been fertilized. The timing of this nondisjunction is important, because it leads to a person having some cells with the typical 46 chromosomes, and some cells with 47 (these cells have an extra copy of chromosome 21). Because only some cells have the extra chromosome, mosaic Down syndrome may have less prominent symptoms than trisomy 21.\n"

msgid "*Osteoarthritis* - in this disease, the top layer of the cartilage covering the bones within the joint softens, breaks down, and wears away, which allows the bones underneath to rub against each other every time you bend. The continual grating causes the ends of the bones to thicken, narrowing the gap between them, which causes pain, swelling and loss of motion in the joint.  Everyone’s joints undergo wear-and-tear over time, but osteoarthritis is more than just that, as we now know that it is a disease that affects the entire joint including the cartilage, synovial membranes, ligaments, and bone. Sometimes bits of frayed cartilage or bone fragments can break off inside the joint, causing more pain and damage. Osteoarthritis can damage any joint in your body, but most commonly occurs in the weight-bearing joints including your knees, hips and spine, often starting in just one joint. Other joints that have been previously injured or overused may also be affected, e.g., the joints in your hands.  "

What do you think they might be? 1) Using aggressive combination treatments including biologics at first to gain good control of inflammation in patients with recent-onset rheumatoid arthritis appears to pave the way for effective maintenance therapy with the cheaper conventional drugs - this approach has been used in the treatment of cancer, and is known as “induction-maintenance” treatment.  2) Dosing-down of biologics in patients with established rheumatoid arthritis appears to continue to provide effective disease control at much lower cost.

msgid "- Obesity is an important risk factor for osteoarthritis. Why do you think that might be? Most obese patients will have knee joint deformities that cause misalignment of the joint, which alters the load distribution on the knee and accelerates cartilage composition and degeneration. The increase in force on the knee and hip joints is probably the primary reason that these joints are more susceptible to osteoarthritis. However, new research is also showing that fat cells may play an important role in regulating bone and cartilage metabolism in joints, and this gets out of balance if you are obese. "

Rheumatoid factor is any one of several autoantibodies (antibodies that attack your own tissue). Testing for this can help your doctor determine whether you have osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis; although, sometimes the test gives a positive result for a different reason, and a negative test result does not necessarily mean you don’t have the disease.

msgid "With rheumatoid arthritis, joint problems usually begin in your hands and feet, but as this disease progresses, your wrists, elbows, ankles, knees, hips, and shoulders may also be affected. For most people, the symptoms appear in the same joints on both sides of the body at the same time. Later in the course of the disease, other tissues and organs such as your skin, lungs, and blood vessels may also become inflamed. In some cases, rheumatoid arthritis will flare up, and your symptoms will be worse; however, after these flares calm down, they are often followed by periods of time where your symptoms fade and may even disappear altogether."

msgid "- Having access to a healthcare team can be very beneficial for a person living with Parkinson’s disease. Why would that be? A patient with a multifactorial disease such as Parkinson’s can benefit hugely from having access to the expertise of a team of experts who can manage the diverse symptoms and side effects, while maximising quality of life. Ideally, the team should include a movement disorder specialist, a speech language specialist, a physiotherapist, an occupational therapist, and a social worker. Working as a team, these individuals are well positioned to access and integrate additional help from nutritionists, psychologists or psychiatrists, as required. "

Your brain contains millions of neurons, which process and transmit information. It receives information via neurons from all parts of your body, processes it, and then sends out instructions to other parts of your body to produce specific actions. The information travels along neurons as electrical impulses. When a nerve impulse reaches the junction between two neurons, a chemical *neurotransmitter* (think of it as a bike courier carrying information from one building to the next) is released that stimulates the impulse in the next neuron so that it continues on to its destination."

In Parkinson’s, clumps of protein known as Lewy bodies build up inside the dopamine producing neurons, which steadily degenerate and eventually die. The death of dopamine producing neurons means less dopamine, and without enough dopamine other parts of your brain cannot operate properly. Ultimately, this makes walking, reaching for objects and other basic movements very difficult. Additional loss of dopamine in other regions of your brain and in your intestines, is thought to be at least partly to blame for some of the secondary symptoms of Parkinson’s.  "

Most of these fall into three major categories, autonomic or involuntary symptoms, cognitive and psychiatric symptoms, and sleep disorders; for example, you may lose your sense of smell, find you are sweating a lot, have signs of depression, or have trouble sleeping. However, because every case is unique, it is impossible to predict which of these you might experience. That said, psychiatric symptoms such as nightmares, hallucinations and dementia often become more problematic in the later stages of the disease. "

Once you have been diagnosed, your doctor will be able to advise you whether or not to start treatment. There are many drugs available, but they don’t necessarily work the same for everyone, which means your medication will need to be fine-tuned to your individual needs. One of the most commonly used medications for Parkinson’s is called levodopa. Levodopa is usually taken in combination with carbidopa, which stops the levodopa from being broken down by the body before it reaches the brain. This means lower doses of levodopa can be given, which reduces the frequency of side effects. "

msgid "*Treatment:* There is no cure for celiac disease, and the only effective treatment is complete avoidance of gluten for life. A gluten-free diet requires avoiding all foods made from wheat, rye, and barley; for example, breads, cereals, pasta, crackers, cakes, pies, pastries, cookies, biscuits. Oats contain prolamins known as avenins, which are non toxic to the vast majority of people with celiac disease.$^4$ However, it may be advisable to avoid them too, at least initially, due to the possibility that oats or oat-based foods are contaminated with other grains. If you have celiac disease try to stick to that gluten free diet, as the intestinal villi will recover completely within a year in two out of three cases; however, even a year is not long enough for people with more severe intestinal damage.$^5$ "

msgid "For most people, there is no reason to avoid eating foods containing gluten. However, in addition to the gluten intolerance that affects people with celiac disease, another group of people report experiencing a non-celiac *gluten sensitivity* that causes similar symptoms. Notably, people with this condition do not test positive for celiac disease or for a wheat allergy. Gluten sensitivity causes a range of symptoms such as “foggy mind”, lack of energy or lethargy, gas, bloating, abdominal pain or cramps, diarrhea and sometimes constipation, but does not  do the intestinal damage that occurs with celiac disease. The pathophysiology of this condition is currently poorly understood, and at this point, although it is referred to as gluten sensitivity it is not known whether gluten or another chemical component in wheat is responsible for the symptoms. There is no specific diagnostic test for gluten sensitivity. A diagnosis is made if you test negative for celiac disease or wheat allergy, and your symptoms resolve when you start a gluten-free diet, and start again when gluten is reintroduced. As with celiac disease, there is no cure for gluten sensitivity, and the only treatment is a gluten-free diet."

msgid "Gluten is a mixture of proteins, called prolamins that are found in cereal grains, especially wheat (gliadins and a glutenins), barley (hordeins), and rye (secalins). Gluten is somewhat resistant to digestion in the small intestine, so that when you eat food containing gluten, the digestive enzymes that normally break down proteins into their amino acids building blocks produce short strings of amino acids, called peptides, instead. For people with celiac disease, gluten peptides disrupt the lining of the small intestine and trigger an immune response that attracts inflammatory cells and increases the release of inflammatory chemicals. With continued exposure to gluten, the inflammatory response erodes the tiny villi (known as villous atrophy) of the intestinal wall, shortening and flattening them so they are unable to effectively absorb nutrients (malabsorption)."

msgid "*Crohn’s disease:* although it most commonly affects the bowel, Crohn’s disease can involve any part of the gastrointestinal tract from the mouth to the anus. Diseased segments, called “skip areas” are typically separated by stretches of normal bowel. Tissue damage often extends past the mucosal layer right through to the serosa. As the tissue heals, it may produce an abnormal tunnel-like connection, known as a fistula, which connects the intestine to another organ or tissue. For example, an enterovesical fistula connects the intestines and the bladder, which may cause frequent urinary tract infections."

msgid "*Diagnosis:* there is no single test to diagnose inflammatory bowel disease, so your healthcare provider will typically begin by ruling out other possible conditions such as irritable bowel syndrome, diverticulitis, or colon cancer. Several tests may be performed to help confirm the diagnosis including blood tests to identify anemia or infection, and to determine whether or not there is blood in your stool. Your healthcare provider may also recommend one or more procedures that provide images of the inside of your gastrointestinal tract. These may be endoscopic or imaging procedures. Endoscopy typically involves the insertion of a thin tube with a light and camera that provides images of the inner walls of your colon, small intestine, or stomach. Imaging may be by x-ray, computerized tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. "

msgid "*Gut microflora:* your body co-exists with trillions of microorganisms, collectively called the microflora. These microbes colonize every surface that is exposed to the outside world, including your digestive tract. The number of bacteria steadily increases as you proceed down the digestive tract to the colon, which contains almost 70% of the microbes in your entire body. The bacteria in your colon help you in a variety of ways. For example, they digest components of food that has not been digested by your small intestine, train your mucosal immune system to be tolerant to beneficial microbes, prevent the growth of harmful bacteria, and produce hormones that regulate fat storage, and vitamins such as vitamin K. Each person’s microflora is unique and, if you are a healthy adult, generally fairly stable. However, infection and disease can destabilize the microflora, which disturbs the normal functioning of the gastrointestinal tract."

msgid "*Mucosal immune system:* your immune system has the important job of fighting off disease-causing organisms (pathogens) when they end up inside your body. In the gut, the mucosal component of your immune system has to eliminate any pathogens that are ingested, while at the same time tolerating the beneficial microbes in the microflora. This is achieved in several ways: 1) the mucosa itself is designed as a strong physical barrier that protects against pathogenic infection; 2) specific types of immune cells that are primed for attack, are held at strategic locations throughout the intestines; and 3) multiple immune adaptations make local immune responses less vigorous, preventing a chronic full blown immune response. Any inflammation that is triggered by the mucosal immune system as part of a normal immune response required to eliminate pathogenic microbes invading the gut is quickly controlled as the mucosal cells regenerate and repair. This is much like the swelling that may happen when; for example, you bump your knee on a chair. The resulting lump is due to local inflammation that subsides as your immune system repairs the damage."

msgid "*Treatment:* Because inflammatory bowel diseases can develop via many different mechanisms the response to different treatments varies widely from one person to another, and is the reason why there is no universal treatment. There are currently five classes of medications available to treat inflammatory bowel disease. These are aminosalicylates,  antibiotics, corticosteroids, immunomodulators, and biologic therapies. Aminosalicylates are often the first medicines used to treat inflammatory bowel disease. They alter immune responses, which reduces the acute inflammatory response in inflammatory bowel disease, but unfortunately they may also cause unpleasant intestinal side effects and headaches. If you have a fever, your healthcare provider may prescribe antibiotics to help control any infection, which may also help heal fistulas in people with Crohn’s disease. Corticosteroids may be given to reduce inflammation if you don’t respond to initial treatments, or in moderate to severe cases of ulcerative colitis or Crohn’s disease; however, they have numerous, sometimes severe side effects, so are usually reserved for short term use. Immunomodulators and biologic therapies reduce inflammation indirectly by suppressing the immune system. In some cases, two or more drugs may be prescribed together for best effect. These medications have widely varying side effect profiles that may affect their suitability on an individual basis. With these drugs in hand, two main treatment strategies, the step-up approach (the more traditional approach), and the top-down approach are often applied to guide therapy."

Disease specific complications include toxic megacolon (a life-threatening, severe distention of the colon) and increased risk of colon cancer, which are more commonly associated with ulcerative colitis; and narrowing or obstruction of the bowel, fistulae, apthous ulcers (mouth ulcers) and perianal disease, which are more commonly associated with Crohn’s disease and contribute to a significantly increased risk of death. In addition to all of this, you may also be predisposed to other inflammatory disorders such as arthritis, skin conditions, inflammation associated with eye, liver, or kidney diseases, or bone loss, with arthritis being the most common."

Finally, nutritional supplements may be given in a way that gives your bowels a break by temporarily reducing inflammation; for example, via a vein, known as parenteral nutrition.

msgid "Inflammatory bowel diseases occur due to complex interactions between your genes, your gut microflora, environmental factors, and malfunctions in your immune system. Different genetic abnormalities have been identified that cause defects in the mucosal barrier and immune responses, as well as preventing efficient bacterial clearance. Although the exact mechanisms are not yet known, a popular theory is that your mucosal immune system fails to down regulate inflammation after it has been activated in response to an environmental trigger in your gut, such as an acute infection, or continual use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (which can irritate the gut lining). As it turns out, many factors can stimulate or inhibit mucosal immune responses, including the types and proportions of different microbes in your microflora, your diet, smoking, stress, and exposure to non-steroidal antiinflammatories (which may irritate the lining of the gut). Smoking is particularly unusual, because although it exacerbates Crohn’s disease, it is protective against ulcerative colitis. However, it is worth noting that nicotine patches seem to be less effective at protecting against ulcerative colitis than cigarettes, suggesting additional factors are involved. Regardless of these facts, the harms caused by smoking far outweigh the benefits of quitting. "

The signs and symptoms of both diseases are generally similar, so if you have either of these diseases, you are likely to experience one or more of the following: diarrhea, fever and fatigue, abdominal pain and cramping, blood in your stool, reduced appetite, and weight loss. The severity of symptoms however, can vary widely. For example, while it’s possible you may only have rectal bleeding, it’s also possible you may experience severe pain, extreme diarrhea, bleeding, fever, and an inability to eat. For many people, inflammatory bowel disease has a severe impact on quality of life due to debilitating recurring symptoms that can interfere with work and career choices, social interaction, and physical intimacy."

msgid "Your digestive system, also called the gastrointestinal tract, or gut has two main functions - digestion and absorption of nutrients. It is composed of several structures that are arranged linearly in your body, from top to bottom, starting with the mouth, followed by the esophagus, stomach, small intestine, large intestine (colon) and rectum, and ending with the anus. Each structure is adapted to perform specific functions. Digestion, or the breakdown of food begins in your mouth, where it is chewed and hydrated before you swallow it. As it passes through your digestive system, it is broken down by digestive enzymes into nutrients that are small enough to be absorbed into your bloodstream such as simple sugars and amino acids, the building blocks of carbohydrates and protein. Your stomach is like a dynamic storage tank; it not only holds and concentrates the food, but also churns it up with digestive enzymes, which start to digest protein, and sterilizes it in preparation for its journey through the small intestine where 90% of the digestion and absorption of nutrients occurs. Large quantities of water are secreted into the small intestine to help with the digestive process, much of which is later reabsorbed. Having passed through the small intestine, what’s left enters your colon where it is further digested and any nutrients that are produced are absorbed. Your colon also reabsorbs much of the remaining water, as well as processing and preparing waste products for elimination. "

msgid "Many people with bipolar disorder eat more sugar when they have depressive episodes and manic episodes. Why do you think that is? Some doctors believe that they’re actually self-medicating! Sugary snacks can have powerful effects on the brain’s neurotransmitters  (especially serotonin) and can help moods feel less extreme. The effects are usually short lived because the body processes simple sugars so quickly. So, while it may be tempting to self-medicate with sugar, people with bipolar disorder should choose nutrient dense foods like complex carbohydrates and lean proteins – even though a sugar high feels great for a while, a balanced diet is better for their symptoms in the long run."

"**How are things supposed to work normally?**\n"
"Usually, your brain works constantly to gather and understand information about your body and its environment. To do this efficiently, your brain uses chemical messengers called neurotransmitters to help cells communicate with one another. Each neurotransmitter carries different messages throughout the brain and has important roles in controlling the body’s systems and functions. For example, normally glutamate manages the flow of information throughout the brain and keeps messages from becoming overwhelming, while dopamine tells different parts of the brain to turn on and off.  When neurotransmitters work together properly, you are able to accurately perceive and interact with the world around you.\n"
"[[☃ image 1]]\n"
"**What happens when things go wrong?**\n"
"Sometimes the communication system breaks down because there is too much or too little of a neurotransmitter in the brain (there is a *chemical imbalance*).  When this happens, information isn’t processed correctly and the brain starts to make mistakes when it tries to interpret information or tell the rest of the body how to act. The effects of chemical imbalances can change based on the area of the brain that is affected and the neurotransmitters that are involved. Psychotic disorders are linked to abnormally high amounts of dopamine and low amounts of glutamate in many different parts of the brain, including areas that are involved in gathering and processing information about the world, controlling the body’s movement and emotions, thinking critically, and learning new things."

"*Medications:*\n"
"The medications used to treat schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, and schizotypal personality disorder are called antipsychotics. Antipsychotics improve the functioning of different neurotransmitters in the brain, which shortens the duration of psychosis and prevents reoccurrences. Typical antipsychotics and atypical antipsychotics both focus on blocking dopamine and are used to improve symptoms like delusions, hallucinations, and changes in thoughts or speech. Atypical antipsychotics also focus on other neurotransmitters (like serotonin), so they can be used to improve negative symptoms as well, like anhedonia and flat affect."

Each year, 1% of Americans are diagnosed with schizophrenia, 0.3% are diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder, and 4.6% are diagnosed with schizotypal personality disorder. Men are more likely to be diagnosed with schizophrenia and schizotypal personality disorder, and women are more likely to be diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder. Many people with psychotic disorders are at a high risk for suicide, and approximately 1/3 attempt suicide after being diagnosed."

Almost all patients (recovered or not) have to stay on medication for the rest of their life, and many end up living at inpatient psychiatric facilities. Even after receiving successful treatment, many don’t have a normal life – almost 86% of patients with schizophrenia are disabled or unemployed."

Instead of prevention, many health providers stress the importance of identifying symptoms of psychotic disorders before they become severe and debilitating. Early diagnosis and treatment can improve the person’s long term outcomes and increase their chance recovery. That said, if you have a history of psychiatric problems in your family, it is really important to be proactive with your health and avoid drugs and alcohol (especially cannabis) since it may affect your risk of developing a psychotic disorder."

In fact, after the first three months (trimester) your appetite generally increases so that you are consuming about 300 extra calories a day. Although in the first trimester you can expect to gain just a few pounds, it’s normal to gain about a pound per week for the rest of your pregnancy.

msgid "*Gastrointestinal:* As your uterus grows, it puts pressure on your digestive organs including your colon, gallbladder, liver, and stomach. This can impair their function, and lead to constipation, gallstones, reduced bile transport, as well as a general slowing of the digestive process that is related to lower levels of the hormone gastrin. Gastrin stimulates the secretion of stomach acid, which in turn leads to the production of pepsin, an enzyme that digests proteins in your food - less gastrin leads to slower digestion. In addition to this, elevated progesterone levels during pregnancy slacken the cardiac sphincter, the “door” between your esophagus and stomach, making it open more easily. It is very common to experience heartburn due to acid reflux into your esophagus during the third trimester, as the cardiac sphincter cannot withstand the pressure that builds up in your stomach as your uterus grows. Its also worth noting that taking analgesics during pregnancy may not be for the best, as they can slow down gastric emptying even more, creating an even higher pressure that the cardiac sphincter must withstand."

Overall, this has the effect of diluting the blood, often resulting in  “physiological anemia of pregnancy” (a relative deficiency of red blood cells). Iron requirements increase during pregnancy as the fetus and placenta grow, and as the red blood cell numbers rise. Iron is essential for red blood cell production, and supplements are often needed as the amount of iron absorbed from the diet and recruited from iron stores is often not enough. Several hormones are thought to play a role in changing blood composition to support pregnancy including the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone hormonal system, atrial natriuretic peptide, estrogen, and progesterone, although exactly how they do this is not clear. Whatever the mechanism, the increased blood volume is very important as it ensures that the extra blood needed to supply the growing uterus and placenta is available, and can help protect the mother against normal blood loss that occurs while giving birth.

msgid "*Hormonal:* The menstrual cycle refers to the normal changes in your ovaries and uterus that make an egg accessible for fertilization and prepare your uterus for pregnancy. It typically occurs once every 28 days. If you are ovulating normally, an egg, or ovum emerges from one or other of your ovaries, leaving behind a structure called the corpus luteum. This structure produces large amounts of progesterone and estrogen, hormones that help prepare your uterus for implantation of a fertilized egg. If the egg is not fertilized, the corpus luteum degenerates, causing progesterone and estrogen levels to drop, and menstruation to begin. If the ovum is fertilized, on the other hand, the corpus luteum remains intact and continues to maintain the hormone levels you need to keep your uterus baby-friendly. Eventually, the placenta develops the ability to secrete the necessary hormones itself, and the corpus luteum typically disappears after 3 to 4 months."

msgid "*Immune tolerance:* Your growing fetus is a foreign object, something that your immune system is normally programmed to attack and reject. In order to prevent this from happening, as soon as the embryo becomes implanted in the uterine wall, a key pathway that usually triggers the launch of an immune attack is turned off, making this part of your immune system dormant, and preventing immune cells from targeting the fetus or placenta. In addition to making it possible for you to grow your baby, there can be secondary benefits of pregnancy-related changes in immune function. In particular, women suffering from diseases caused by immune disorders, such as rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, and psoriasis, may find relief from disease symptoms during pregnancy due to increased levels of anti-inflammatory steroids that occur naturally.

msgid "*Integumentary:* The integumentary system consists of your skin, hair and nails, as well as underlying connective tissue that attaches your skin to your body and various glands including sweat and oil producing glands, and your mammary glands. As your pregnancy proceeds, your skin stretches to accommodate your growing uterus and breast tissue. Sometimes the stretching can tear the underlying connective tissue causing red or purple marks to appear on your abdomen, commonly known as stretch marks. In addition, increased estrogen levels during pregnancy increases the production of melanin, the pigment that gives human skin and hair its color. This often causes the ring of colour around your nipples (areolae) to darken, and may create a line of pigment that typically runs from your navel to your pubic bone. Its also possible you may develop patchy discoloration of your face and darkening of any moles and freckles. Other integumentary changes that may occur during pregnancy include accelerated nail growth and excessive hair growth in unusual places, while increased blood supply to your skin often leads to increased perspiration. Finally, while it’s commonly said that pregnancy makes your skin clear and radiant, it’s also possible for it to become oily and acne prone. "

msgid "*Renal:*  Your kidneys are responsible for filtering waste products from your blood, and regulating blood pressure and electrolytes; for example, sodium (Na$^+$), potassium (K$^+$) and calcium (Ca2$^+$). During pregnancy, changes in kidney function approximately follow changes in cardiac function - both organs work considerably harder. By around the 20th week, and sometimes as early as the 8th to 10th week of pregnancy, your kidneys are filtering 30% to 50% more blood than before you were pregnant. The effects of this are greater reabsorption of sodium, and increased elimination of sugars (glycosuria), amino acids (aminoaciduria), and creatinine in your urine (creatinine clearance tests are often used by doctors as a measure of how well your kidneys are working). After about the 12th week of pregnancy, progesterone, a smooth muscle relaxant, causes the tubes that transport urine from the kidneys to the bladder, called the ureters, to dilate. As your uterus expands, it may compress the dilated ureters, obstructing the flow of urine to your bladder, and increasing the chances that you get a urinary tract, or kidney infection while you are pregnant. Laying down on your side can help relieve the pressure on your major blood vessels letting your kidneys work more effectively. However, this can make for a lot of urine production and toilet breaks during the night when you are trying to sleep. "

msgid "Pregnancy is the time from fertilization of an egg, also known as conception, to birth. Getting pregnant and growing a human from scratch is a very complicated biological process that takes a lot of resources. As a result, pregnancy can have a wide range of effects on the mother, both physically and emotionally. "

msgid "This is achieved by increasing the stroke volume, which is the amount of blood pumped out of your heart with each heartbeat. Your cardiac output peaks around week 24 of your pregnancy, when it is 30%-40% higher than normal. As the fetus grows, your uterus begins to crowd your aorta, the major artery that carries oxygenated blood to your tissues and organs and and vena cava, the major vein that carries deoxygenated blood back to your heart. Sometimes, certain positions, such as lying on your back, puts excess pressure on these vessels, which can lead to a drop in blood pressure causing dizziness, fainting, and in some cases, even damage to the fetus. In addition, exercise or activities that change heart rate tend to put a greater demand on your cardiovascular system when you are pregnant than they normally would, and the large changes in cardiac output associated with pregnancy may add additional strain for women with pre-existing heart conditions, such as valvular heart disease, or coronary heart disease. One other relatively common cardiovascular complication of pregnancy is varicose veins, which are enlarged, swollen veins that typically develop in the legs. During pregnancy, your growing uterus puts pressure on your veins making it harder for the blood to flow back to your heart. This causes the blood to pool in the veins making them swell.  "

msgid "Whether your home pregnancy test is positive or not, a visit to your healthcare provider can confirm if you are pregnant. Much like the home pregnancy test, this is usually done by testing a urine sample or blood sample for human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG). Your healthcare provider may also perform a physical exam of your uterus and cervix, looking for other physical signs that you are pregnant. For example there may be signs that your uterus has enlarged, that your cervix is larger and softer, or that your cervix is blueish in colour. Less commonly, and usually only if you are experiencing vaginal bleeding or abdominal pain, your healthcare provider may recommend a transvaginal ultrasound to confirm whether you are pregnant. The earliest observable pregnancy-related change that can be seen with ultrasound is the development of a gestational sac. Later, ultrasound images are commonly used to monitor fetal development over the course of pregnancy."

msgid "Why is prenatal care important? Prenatal care exists to help you and your baby be as healthy as possible. It is a good idea to visit your healthcare provider as soon as you think you might be pregnant, as they can help you identify and avoid any possible issues that may affect your health or the health of your baby. Regular check-ups throughout your pregnancy help your healthcare provider to spot and treat any problems early on, and give you an opportunity to discuss things you can do to give your baby the best start in life."
