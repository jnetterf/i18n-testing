"Read the passage below and answer the question. \n"
"\n"
">The founders of Virginia, having discovered in tobacco a substitute for the sugar of the West Indies and the silver of Peru, still felt the lack of native labor force with which to exploit the new crop. At first they turned to their own overpopulated country for labor, but English indentured servants . . . when their terms of servitude expired . . . struck out for themselves and joined the ranks of those demanding rather than supplying labor. But there was a way out. The Spanish and Portuguese had already demonstrated what could be done in the New World when a local labor force became inadequate: they brought in natives of Africa.\n"

"From Edmund S. Morgan, historian, *The Labor Problem at Jamestown, 1607-18*, 1971.\n"

"> “There were four chiefs: Mr. Bear, Cougar, Bald Eagle, and Salmon. They met to try to figure out what it was that they were going to do. They knew of a place where there were many salmon. This would be the best thing of the coming people. It would keep them strong and healthy; besides, it would taste so good! But there was a problem. The salmon were being held way up river by a dam and were being guarded by some women, who when crossed would stop at nothing to destroy anything that got in the way of keeping their salmon and doing their work.”\n"
