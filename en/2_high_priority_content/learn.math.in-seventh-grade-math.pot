Mode of a set of observations is the observation in the data that occurs most often. Median refers to the value which lie in the middle of data, when arranged in increasing or decreasing order. Let's learn about them in detail."

A triangle in which all the three sides are of equal lengths and the measure of each angle is 60 degree is called an 'equilateral' triangle , whereas a triangle with two sides equal is called 'Isosceles'. Also, the angles opposite to equal sides of an isosceles triangle are equal and on the basis of this property, we are going to find missing angles of triangles. These also have the proofs for the properties of isosceles and equilateral triangles that use congruence of triangles. If you are yet to learn congruence, you can watch the proofs after you learn congruence of triangles. "
